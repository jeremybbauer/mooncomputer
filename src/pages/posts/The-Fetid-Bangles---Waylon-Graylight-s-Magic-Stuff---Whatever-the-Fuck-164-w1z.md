Those that are able to commune with the Earthsoul, deities birthed before human existence, or those stuck-up alien civilizations that visited during that period know what killed the dinosaurs. Frankly, I’m surprised it still hasn’t reached Hollywood. The dinosaurs were wiped out by a zombie apocalypse, though information as to the source of the infection varies wildly.

It should also be clear to all but beginners in the eldritch, stubbed-toe-on-a-rainy-day-when-the-rent’s-late-and-your-significant-other-just-left-you-for-your-brother’s-friend-with-a-dilapidated-pizza-cart-and-a-stupid-dream-but-at-least-they-have-a-dream-and-you-wish-at-least-that-you-could-say-their-pizza-sucks-but-hauntingly-it-is-a-revelation life that extreme events are powerful. Whether it’s an event of extreme joy or suffering, it’s the most common coalescence of natural, wild magic. So, an entire species of beings wiped out in an extremely brutal way was all but guaranteed to produce some horrible bauble or landmark or land mass that would play out this torture for subsequent eons. (Some people think that only extreme *human* joy or suffering does the trick, but I guess they’ve never been to a circus.)

The Fetid Bangles are a set of nine bangles carved from the bones and teeth of dinosaurs that died during their extinction event. These artifacts are the only things recorded to be imbued with the energy from that event. It begs the question: What awful thing happened in the vicinity of these bones and teeth that was worse than a whole species’ extinction? What caused this focal point? If it was solely the extinction, it would seem that either every archaeological dig where dinosaur bits are discovered would erupt into necromantic and cannibalistic madness, or none at all.

There is an unusual amount of mystery surrounding the bangles. It is still unknown who carved the bangles despite all the communing I mentioned at the beginning. And why. And why the event and the probably terrifying party responsible are hidden from all divination. Also, from which dinosaurs they originate. That last one isn’t really important…but I really want to know. I won’t divulge my favorites. I’ve been laughed at too much over it.

But, to the utility of the Fetid Bangles. The most common effects the bangles have produced are A) turning relatively normal people into mad cannibals or B) raising and controlling the dead. Based on incidents involving the bangles, it seems that no one has been able to figure out their true nature, only aspects. A few people have tried to use the bangles to contact or resurrect loved ones who’ve passed, bless their hearts, but it only ever ends up being more of a tragedy than when the wielder’s intent is malicious. “Oh, your grandmother Fanny is in the room with us now. No, I mean really. Look behind you. Oh, no, she’s gone to dust again. Oh, there she is! You can do it, Fanny! Oh…Dust again. Oh, there she goes! I think she’s got it now. Fanny, no, I don’t think we should hug. Talk to your granddaughter here, I don’t know you. Oh, well, oaky. You’re indeed a kind soul. This is actually quite ni — ah! Return my ear at once!”

Many attempts have been made to destroy them, but they’re made of old, hard magic. The best thing anyone has found to do is to scatter them across the globe. The big shell game. Once, a bangle was even taken up to the International Space Station. I’m sure you can guess how that turned out (space ghosts, and more).
