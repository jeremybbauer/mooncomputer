excerpt: Ginny took off back down the mountain, leaving her pack. I watched her
  for a bit as the foliage crept higher and higher in her descent. It moved up
  her shoulders and neck, over her head, and then all you could see was the
  little dances of leaves in her trail till those faded too.

Old Bill and I made our way up to the circled spot on the map. The injured tourist had a strip of gauze around his head with a small stain of red a few inches above the temple. He was laying on the ground with Ginny’s pack under his head. Ginny was sitting beside him, looking a little nervous still, but happy to see us.

“Hey, Coop,” she said. “I bandaged him best I could, but he might have a concussion. His melon seems a little woozy.”

“You did real good, as always, Ginny,” I said.

“Normally, I’d stay and help, but I gotta take off. Can you manage it okay?”

“Oh, yeah. Sure.”

Ginny took off back down the mountain, leaving her pack. I watched her for a bit as the foliage crept higher and higher in her descent. It moved up her shoulders and neck, over her head, and then all you could see was the little dances of leaves in her trail till those faded too. 

I looked back at the tourist. I didn’t see any weapons or anything, and he wasn’t too big. He had an expensive, heavy-duty coat that wasn’t right for the season, and his shoes looked fancy but weren’t at all right for the terrain. We got his type on the mountain a lot—rich folk with the most expensive gear instead of the right gear. I felt wary cause of Ginny’s odd demeanor, but if there was something sinister about the guy, I couldn’t see it.

“I guess we were ‘bout due for another one,” said Old Bill. “Been about a month since we had to get the last yuppie off the mountain.”

“Yep, guess we were about due,” I said. “They sure get talked outta their money easy. It’s a wonder they have any at all.”

“If they just did a google ‘fore they came, it’d save ‘em a lot of trouble.”

“Yep. Ain’t hard to find a good hiking shoe or a proper tent and such on Google.”

“Hell, they probably don’t trust it. Cause it’s free!” Old Bill leaned his head back and laughed pretty good on that one. Good enough that he had to put his hand on his belly to keep it from hurting when he laughed. He always seemed to like his own jokes more than anyone else did. 

“Pretty good, Bill,” I said. “Guess we oughta start taking him down while we still got some daylight.”

We didn’t have anything against wealthy people coming here to hike the mountain, even though they seemed predisposed to getting in over their heads. They’d come, spend money, check out the mountain, then go home, and didn’t cause much trouble. They were good for the town. Hard not to have fun with them on occasion, though. 

Old Bill pulled the stretcher open and we scooted the man on top of it. “I’ll take the head, Bill. Mind leading with the legs?”

“If I’d known you was gonna ask me to dance, I’da worn my tux.” Old Bill had another belly-hand laugh at that one, but I was ready to get going. I put on Ginny’s pack and grabbed the rails by the tourist’s head. 

“Okay, Bill,” I said. “One…two…three!”
