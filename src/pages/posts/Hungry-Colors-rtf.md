Bro I’m lighting your Carhartt on fire and your face is flickering with hungry colors I’m doing this because you went hard digital became a binary demon and then the jitter smoke you smoked was green bread mold the lake sat calm like an ignored tit affected by nothing and it’s this inertia and the weirdness of your avatar that has forced me to force upon you this wake up of nearly $100 charred and wreathing you in this baptism of flame and the dusking cornstalks do look like beautiful bones and that’s why we’re in this together bro why the lighter’s under my Carhartt too.
