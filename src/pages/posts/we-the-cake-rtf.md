inside you are a crab  
inside a horse  
inside a wedding cake.

every freezer in indiana  
preserves one of your pieces  
and i hope you’re taken  
out for breakfast

so you can get an early start  
on your twelve-legged-world-  
beginning epidemic.

when the ground  
beneath the single wides  
and apartment buildings  
rumbles and erupts

in the most beautiful  
chimerical spores  
this basic world  
has ever had the frothing  
pleasure to see,

you’ll find out that horse  
is an appaloosa with striped  
hooves and an astral leopard  
complex, that crab a fiddler

deformed like an unbalanced  
bodybuilder, emerging at night  
a foamed ghost scuttling  
endlessly  
in waves of fear.

you’ll find out the cake  
served as the catalyst,  
the most important element  
the frosting — composed

of both pulped and liquefied  
people on ecstasy  
tailored in crystal suits.
