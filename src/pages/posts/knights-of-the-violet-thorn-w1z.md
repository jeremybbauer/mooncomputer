“Okay, I hereby bring to order this meeting of the Knights of the Violet Thorn. First point of business, Wendy brought lemon bars.”

“With lavender!”

“Ooo, with lavender. Thank you, Wendy. Everyone, help yourselves to a lemon bar. With lavender. Second point of business, we have a few new faces here tonight. Thank you for coming. Can you introduce yourselves to the group?”

“Um, I guess I’ll go. Hi, I’m Christine.”

“Hi, Christine.”

“Hi! So, Addie is one of my good friends and told me I should check this out, see if it’s for me. I was taking a business class at night, but since I’m not taking any over the summer, I have a little more free time on my hands. I don’t know much about Wicca, it was never really my kind of thing, but I’m open-minded.”

“Great, thanks for coming. Were you under the impression this was a Wicca group?”

“Oh. Yeah. It’s not?”

“No, it’s not.”

“Oh. Addie didn’t say it was, I just kind of thought this was like a nature-y Wicca-type thing, or maybe one of those things where you dress up and use foam swords or something. Like I said, I just have a lot of free time right now. And I try to be pretty open minded.”

“Nope, we don’t practice Wicca here. And we don’t have any foam weaponry.”

“Theresa does Wicca.”

“Oh. I didn’t know that. Thank you, Wendy. I don’t mean no one here can do Wicca, I just mean this isn’t a group for doing Wicca. Anyone can do whatever they want outside of the group. I respect you, Theresa, and I hope I didn’t offend you.”

“Nope, I’m good. If anyone has any questions about being Wiccan pr practicing Wicca, feel free to ask me whatever.”

“That’s really kind of you, Theresa.  Third point of business, then: if anyone has any questions about Wicca, you can discuss them with Theresa during the break or after the meeting at her discretion. Theresa, don’t feel obligated to answer any questions you’re not comfortable with, of course. I’ll also remind everyone that mutual respect is one of the foundational tenets of this group. Keep that in mind when asking Theresa your questions. Now, back to our second point of business. Do any of the other new people want to introduce themselves?”

“I’ll go. Hey, I’m Brenda. I was on Wendy’s roller derby team until I got kicked out for my ‘hyper aggressive behavior.’ I head-butted a few refs over some bad calls. And a soda machine. And a horse. It was a weird day. I just, I have a lot of aggression I need to get out. Since I don’t have derby anymore, I figured a fight club was the next best thing.”

“Thank you for coming, Brenda. Did you say ‘fight club’?”

“Yeah. That’s what this is, isn’t it? The Knights of the Violent Thorn?”

“Oh, that’s vio*let*. With a *t*.”

“Oh. Uh, okay. So what do you do here?”

“We’ll get to that. And maybe make some pamphlets in the future to help avoid these mixups. Now we can move on to our fourth point of business: reciting the oath and offering the sacrifice.”
