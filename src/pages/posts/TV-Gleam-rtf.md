_The wood-framed television_ \
_of your dusked basement flickers_ \
_from the talking golden retriever_ \
_and its family, drowned out by laugh-_ \
_track, to black and white snow_ \
_roaring with failed connection._ \
_A voice emerges, short of breath,_ \
_fluctuating with strange magnetism._

Mayday May…day…This is Jesse Gibson, \
the Nuclear Man. Mission ZΨ2573, Op… \
Operation Infinitum, has suffered heavy \
setbacks. Our arrival in Universe 2 was… \
success. We landed on an un..own planet \
resembling Earth..ut with zero continental \
drift…..We decided to call it Pan..ea. Upon \
close…closer inspection, we found the \
planet uninhabited…..Completely uni..abited. \
……..couldn’t figure out..why…….so dark \
during….day…………..

_The stale basement air feels_ \
_heavy, like your surroundings_ \
_are anticipating something_ \
_you cannot alone sense. You’ve_ \
_turned the volume knob just so_ \
_you can make out the gasping_ \
_man’s words without your parents,_ \
_in their room above you, waking_ \
_from the interrupting howls of static._

The..lanet first read inhospitable \
to..uman physiologies, but strangely \
sh.fted….Somehow it changed….. \
atmosphere to…commodate us, but… \
couldn’t..ell we were different…… \
normal humans….Emily could channel \
something…..felt presence of..arge \
consciousness….She….d us to…cave \
with strange marking…..We found \
food..ater in this cave. Thought it…….. \
…..trying to help….just want……energies.

_The television returns to the talking_ \
_dog and family. The volume is now_ \
_too low to hear what they’re saying,_ \
_but the laugh track piques into the_ \
_audible every ten to fifteen seconds._ \
_You reach to clap the side of the TV_ \
_when within a few inches of it you feel_ \
_the hairs on your hand rise and the_ \
_blood within your arm buzz as if_ \
_being filled with electric current._ \
_The scrambled black and white_ \
_confetti returns._

…couldn’t have predict…….Universe 2 \
would affect……and I’s abilities….My \
power….similar but diff……Stronger. \
Emily…pears to have transcended… \
..nother realm……appened before, but \
not…..this. I fear she may……yond \

..iffcult than predict…If you….hearing \
this mess…….are the only…….save us. \

_You’ve left the volume unchanged,_ \
_but the man is growing louder. He_ \
_sounds as if he’s just behind a door_ \
_in front of you. The screen starts_ \
_to flash blank, then return, flash_ \
_blank, then return. After five_ \
_cycles of this, you notice_ \
_it’s gotten brighter every time._

_Your skin is tingling from the pins_ \
_and needles in the air. You think_ \
_of how your family never takes_ \
_vacations, how everything will be_ \
_different next year in high school._ \
_You wonder why your mind is racing._ \
_Sometimes, you think you hear small_ \
_pops in the air, or maybe a tiny_ \
_crackling. You close your eyes but_ \
_the light doesn’t stop at your eyelids._

………works.

_The television flashes blank_ _again. You count_\
_the seconds_ _and you hear angry footsteps_ \
_from the floor above, each step_ _falling like_\
_thunder. You reach fifteen before the penetrating_\
_burst_ _of light from the screen. You can_ _feel it_\
_in your blood, in your bones_ _and lungs and_\
_you try to look at_ _your hands but you can’t tell_ \
_where your skin and body end_ \
_and the light begins._
