T*he wood-framed television*   
*of your dusked basement flickers*   
*from the talking golden retriever*   
*and its family, drowned out by laugh-*   
*track, to black and white snow*   
*roaring with failed connection.*   
*A voice emerges, short of breath,*   
*fluctuating with strange magnetism.*

* * *

Mayday May…day…This is Jesse Gibson,   
the Nuclear Man. Mission ZΨ2573, Op…   
Operation Infinitum, has suffered heavy   
setbacks. Our arrival in Universe 2 was…   
success. We landed on an un..own planet   
resembling Earth..ut with zero continental   
drift…..We decided to call it Pan..ea. Upon   
close…closer inspection, we found the   
planet uninhabited…..Completely uni..abited.   
……..couldn’t figure out..why…….so dark   
during….day…………..

* * *

*The stale basement air feels*   
*heavy, like your surroundings*   
*are anticipating something*   
*you cannot alone sense. You’ve*   
*turned the volume knob just so*   
*you can make out the gasping*   
*man’s words without your parents,*   
*in their room above you, waking*   
*from the interrupting howls of static.*

* * *

The..lanet first read inhospitable   
to..uman physiologies, but strangely   
sh.fted….Somehow it changed…..   
atmosphere to…commodate us, but…   
couldn’t..ell we were different……   
normal humans….Emily could channel   
something…..felt presence of..arge   
consciousness….She….d us to…cave   
with strange marking…..We found   
food..ater in this cave. Thought it……..   
…..trying to help….just want……energies.

* * *

*The television returns to the talking*   
*dog and family. The volume is now*   
*too low to hear what they’re saying,*   
*but the laugh track piques into the*   
*audible every ten to fifteen seconds.*   
*You reach to clap the side of the TV*   
*when within a few inches of it you feel*   
*the hairs on your hand rise and the*   
*blood within your arm buzz as if*   
*being filled with electric current.*   
*The scrambled black and white*   
*confetti returns.*

* * *

…couldn’t have predict…….Universe 2   
would affect……and I’s abilities….My   
power….similar but diff……Stronger.   
Emily…pears to have transcended…   
..nother realm……appened before, but   
not…..this. I fear she may……yond   
saving or even…inding. I’ve found   
one…..machines, this mach……order to   
…..nicate with her, but this prove..   
..iffcult than predict…If you….hearing   
this mess…….are the only…….save us.   
Luck…….machine not only com……..   
..ut transports….

* * *

*You’ve left the volume unchanged,*   
*but the man is growing louder. He*   
*sounds as if he’s just behind a door*   
*in front of you. The screen starts*   
*to flash blank, then return, flash*   
*blank, then return. After five*   
*cycles of this, you notice*   
*it’s gotten brighter every time.*

* * *

The……..as been damaged by stray…….o   
I only have one……………rk. Remember:   
though…….look the..ame, you will be diff…..   
on…..2. There is no tell….what you will ex…   
ience physio…….ly. You may also…..bilities   
you never ha….Universe 1. I’m br……..ou   
here because……is no other hope….I knew   
an..ne…ould gain abilitie…ere. A long   
shot…etter than….shot, eh?

* * *

*Your skin is tingling from the pins*   
*and needles in the air. You think*   
*of how your family never takes*   
*vacations, how everything will be*   
*different next year in high school.*   
*You wonder why your mind is racing.*   
*Sometimes, you think you hear small*   
*pops in the air, or maybe a tiny*   
*crackling. You close your eyes but*   
*the light doesn’t stop at your eyelids.*

* * *

Stan……………Repeat. Standby for…….rt. Don’t   
for……ything may be d…..ent. No telling   
how……..be affected. See y…….., Chief. Let’s   
………works.

* * *

*The television flashes blank* *again. You count*  
*the seconds* *and you hear angry footsteps*   
*from the floor above, each step* *falling like*  
*thunder. You reach fifteen before the penetrating*  
*burst* *of light from the screen. You can* *feel it*  
*in your blood, in your bones* *and lungs and*  
*you try to look at* *your hands but you can’t tell*   
*where your skin and body end*   
*and the light begins.*
