### What we do know 

A few details are loosely corroborated by past and recent sightings of the Moon Computer.

* It must have an internal power source. In each sighting, it appears to be turned on and operational, but does not have any power cables. And it’s been seen in wooded areas, open fields, a sea cave on the Washington coast and another on the coast of Georgia—all places without any electrical sources. 
* It appears to have been constructed in the early to mid-1990s. One person noted that it looked similar to the late models of the Macintosh Quadra, but with some marked differences. The earliest sighting on record is from January 6, 1998, and it’s possible the Moon Computer was built around that time instead using older parts. Some of the wilder theories claim it may have been sighted decades before the first recorded sighting, but there isn’t strong enough evidence to make the theory viable.
* The Moon Computer seems to avoid areas with a large population density. A couple of reports show it appearing in cities, but even then the areas and buildings it appears in are all but abandoned.
* It doesn’t stay in the same place long. Reports vary on the exact length of time the Moon Computer is seen in any one location, but after being spotted, it’s often gone by the next day, sometimes within a few hours.

We know relatively nothing about it. No hard facts, at least. Nothing concrete. Some reports suggest that the Moon Computer may even be dangerous, though the how or why of this hasn’t been fully explained. 

One last thing that we do know about the Moon Computer is that it can be interacted with. This has been touched on in a few sighting reports over the years, but as is the trend, there aren’t a lot of details on these interactions. That remained the case until about a week ago when the Moon Computer was found by a software engineer in Coos Bay, Oregon named Holly Mercado, who may have had more interaction with the Moon Computer than anyone else on record. 

Mercado is also the only person reported to have encountered the Moon Computer twice.
