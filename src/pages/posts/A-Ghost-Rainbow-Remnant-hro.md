The trailers on the hill are still burning. Muscle threads feel, in some movements, like they’re all going the wrong way from both overuse and inexperienced use.

Just yesterday, Jamila felt nothing. The numbness that had been building since high school had peaked when her best friend since seventh grade, Megan, told her that she’d been seeing Jamila’s boyfriend of three years for two years. Jared was dumb and not very interesting, a boyfriend for convenience more than the heart or sexual satisfaction. His lack of interesting qualities was maybe his best quality, but now he’d ruined the one thing he had going for him.

Today Megan came to get some of Jared’s things from Jamila: a gray Jamiroquai hoodie with rips near the elbows, his phone charger, a partially eaten bag of Flamin’ Hot Doritos, his social security card (he said he’d lose it if he had to hang on to it), and mixed bag of gummy candy he got high and forgot behind the couch where he said he had to put it or he was gonna eat the whole damn thing and puke rainbows and worms or something all night (this was the most interesting thing Jamila had ever heard Jared say, and it made her wary, but she thought maybe drugs do expand the mind, but temporarily, and now she was also thinking that this flash of stupid-brilliance should have tipped her off).

Today Jamila thought that she should have felt something, should have cared about her best friend shifting sides, becoming mostly a stranger in less than 24 hours. Instead the only thing she thought she felt was minor inconvenience. While Megan collected Jared’s things, she talked to Jamila about work, her mom’s new boyfriend, a few good memories from their shared past. Jamila wanted to feel annoyed at the falseness, but couldn’t.

Jamila woke up with a sore back she forgot about until it was aggravated by pulling things from hard to reach places. She rolled her shoulder blades, stretched, dug her fists into different points on either side of her spine and pushed to crack the stiffness away. These practices were less and less effective, though.

“I need to sit a minute,” said Jamila.

“Oh, yeah, okay, sure. So the social security card’s in the top of the closet?”

“Yeah, in the black box in the corner. You can go ahead and get it.”

Jamila started to feel tired and short of breath. She leaned forward and rubbed her temples. She didn’t have a headache, but it’s just what you did when you don’t feel right. Her back started to tingle as if a nerve had been hit or it was recovering from being numb.

After a few minutes, the feeling passed and Jamila felt normal and numb again. She leaned forward and rose from her chair to walk towards where Megan was, leaving behind a shadow made of orange and red light.

“Yeah, it’s under the pictures and the old movie tickets,” said Jamila.

“Oh.” Megan seemed to have weakened with each Jared and Jamila memory she’d had to face in that closet. “Got it—”

The explosion sounded composed of both an accelerant and electricity. Like someone stuffed dynamite into a big screen TV, turned it on, and lit a fuse. As Jamila ran out of the closet and the room to see what had happened, another shadow remained behind, this one in a half runner’s pose colored deep blue and algae green.

Megan rose and stumbled after Jamila. Behind her, Jamila heard a pop, some sort of hiss, and wet, muffled screams. When she looked back, all she could see was a few tiny flames dotting her furniture and walls, and one large gelatinous, blue-green mass writhing in the hallway.

For a second she froze.
