They preferred to secret. They were careful.

For the second wave, they used a germ. This crud had the effect of making you feel happier and happier each day, like everything was going just right. At the same time, it ate at your insides, so you waste away as you’ve never felt better. Absolute joy infects absolutely. Dramatic weight loss, thinning hair, brittle bones, organ failure. Like that time I passed out from junkyard sepsis while sneaking some of Momma’s lemon cheesecake. That first bite was damn worth it.

The whole Court was enthralled and so happy no one paid attention to their physical degradation. Old Mr. Grabell found out what was happening, though. The things distributed the germ via The Cluck & Glug Shack’s annual fish and chicken fry. They knew us well enough to know everyone would be bibbed and ready to imbibe that grease and salt and flaky white stuff. Mr. Grabell told us we could make our own decisions, but he wasn’t gonna stop it. He said this germ was better than going from cancer or a bad fall or any other stupid way the world sees fit to have us die by. He lasted just one more week before he died smiling.

It makes you think. It was all different levels of a mindfuck. I thought about Momma. I still can’t tell how I feel about it and most of the Court preferred this doom bliss to what their live was and had been. And they made this known.
