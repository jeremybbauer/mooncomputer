No one understood how she could move through the mountain so fast. Trails that were half a day’s journey took her about 10 minutes. Her gear didn’t seem to be anything special, and she was a good trail runner, but not the fastest anyone here had seen. You’d watch her leave and your eyes would be able to follow her path for a bit before you couldn’t see her anymore. But that ain’t out of the ordinary. 

If someone went down on the mountain—from a fall, a hunting accident, or was just plain lost in there—odds are it was Ginny that’d find them. She’d bandage or splint anything what needed it, and get help in town. People would ask how she got from one end of the mountain to another in such a short amount of time. She’d shrug and say something like, “Just been livin’ on this mountain my whole life.” 

After hearing this from Ginny a few times, I said on day, “Well, I’ve been hikin’ around this mountain a fair amount of time now. I like to think I know it pretty good. But I can’t get around it like you can.”

Ginny said, “When you spend a lot of time with someone, you get to know ‘em like the back of your hand. Even better than they know themselves sometimes. Me and this mountain have spent a lot of time together. I know it, and I figure it knows me pretty good too. And we both know how to listen.”

I wasn’t sure what she meant, but that last part stung a bit. It brought up some feelings, stuff I’d heard before. Regrets, I guess. Laina, Old Bill, and Billy Boy starting hootin’ and hollerin’ at seeing me stun-faced. “Ope, she’s got your number, Coop!” Stuff like that. They were right, but I ignored them. 

I went home to think about some things, and after a couple of hours, I got a knock at my door. Those grabbing green eyes locked on mine right as I opened the door. “Hey, Coop,” said Ginny. “Got another tourist down on the mountain. It looks like he hit his head pretty good.”

She handed me a trail map with the tourist’s location circled, as usual.

“Couldn’t bring him down by myself, at least not with the head injury. He’s kinda in and out of it.” She looked away when she said this. At the time, I wasn’t sure why since I’d helped her get plenty of people off the mountain. I thought it was peculiar, but didn’t think much of it. 

“Okay. I’ll grab Old Bill and we’ll see if we can bring the guy down into town ‘fore it gets too dark. Could you check back on him in the meantime, if it’s not too much trouble?”

“Uh…yeah. I can do that. I’ll see you there Coop.” 

“Appreciate it, Ginny. See ya there.”

Ginny was nervous, an emotion I’d never seen from her. I wondered if this tourist might be dangerous, but she would have said something. I didn’t have much time to think on it, though.
