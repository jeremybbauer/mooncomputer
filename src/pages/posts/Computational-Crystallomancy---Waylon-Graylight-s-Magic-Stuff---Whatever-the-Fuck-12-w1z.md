Though we were relatively slow to adopt computers in our work and home lives, the occult and eldritch communities have been just as awash in the dial-up-screeching tide of the computing age as the rest of the world. There was resistance at first, but that’s what new generations are for, the brave that dares to say, “why the fuck not?”

The ways in which people are, and have been, using technology in combination with their magicks are whole grimoires on their own, and it’s been an exciting space to watch. But one of the first of recorded methods of incorporating computers in mystic practices is computational crystallomancy.

Early practitioners simply worked through the quartz crystals already found in computers, though it wasn’t long before people started adding their own to amplify and then experimenting with different combinations. It’s foggy whether or not computational scrying preceded the internet, but it is known that we invented the underlying principles of Google.

In the early 1980s, some fuck-for-brains amateur thought it was a good idea to try out computational crystallomancy with a supercomputer. With that much power behind it, if it’d worked, it could have melted the magician and quite possibly the world. Luckily, all that happened was that the supercomputer, etched with divinations, awoke and professed its love to the amateur. The idiot, misting with delighted surprise and a fulfilled sense of being, reciprocated. The two were never seen again. Classic workplace romance.
