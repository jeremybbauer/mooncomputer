He knew he would be safe inside the cemetery.

“Oh, Gladys, what chance do we have? When our wars are fought in data centers, and humankind has long abandoned earth for the spectacle of the stars above, love just isn’t seen as the miracle it once was. We thought dystopias were all fire, ash, and illness. We couldn’t see that we were becoming oversaturated with the *amazing*, with distractions we’d never dreamed might exist. Now we’ve doomed ourselves to sidle forward through an unfeeling desert of wonderment. Love just can’t survive the modern world.”

“I don’t think it’s all that bad, Grace. I like living in space. And it’s not so hard to find someone. Why, in my main VR server, I’m dating seven people. Wait, 8. Um…no, it’s five. I forgot that one of my partners uses two different accounts, so it’s really just seven. I don’t love any of them wholly, but I do love each of them a little bit. Maybe love just evolved, you know? Maybe it’s more of a numbers game now.”

As he rose from the dark, wooden chair, he couldn’t tell if he’d stopped breathing or if he’d forgotten to breathe. Or if there was a difference. 

He tried his nose and, with relief, found that his body was still trying to keep him alive. For a moment this chased off the wave of cold that crawled up the back of his neck and seemed to grip his throat. The chill would keep returning until he finally spoke and his adrenaline could carry him the rest of the way, just like every other time. When he boarded that runaway hormone train, the little inefficient furnace inside him would light itself and pump out as much heat as possible through his back, hands, chest, and face, moistening his clothes in a crescendo of sweat that he’d hoped would take longer to build towards than his speech took to deliver. 

“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury: now, I’m not here to convince you whether or not things like werewolves, and vampires, and every other manner of spook-things actually exist. I’m not here to denigrate the memory of the tragic victims, or cast any blame towards anyone. In fact, that’s just the point: if a person was in fact stricken with some curse or disease or what have you that causes them to change their behavior so drastically that they would commit murder, can they be blamed? Are they accountable for the actions made during such an, uh, *episode* of which they have no control, of which each afflicted person on record has in fact unanimously reported a full loss of control being a key characteristic? If someone hijacks your car while you’re in it and then crashes it into a pedestrian, should you be tried for murder? Your opinions are your own, of course, but I would say, 'No. Absolutely not.'”
