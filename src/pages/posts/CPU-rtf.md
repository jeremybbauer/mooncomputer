To-do list:

\-Take out garbage\
-Call Walgreens about debt collector calls\
-Pick up eggs, beer, syrup, bananas\
-Wash dark-delicates\
-Call landlord about ants and silverfish\
-INTERCEPT MARCUS AND THE ORION DEVICE

That last one strikes me as odd \
because I don’t know \
a Marcus \
and don’t remember \
writing it on the list.

Maybe…\
it was a helpful \
prophetic ghost, \
or a dimensional or cosmic \
entity with business here \
but no concept of appropriate \
social graces, \
or myself, a happenstance \
time traveler. \
These reasons \
I could understand.

That last one strikes me,\
and I bet my future self \
has slept with lots \
all over history, a gyrating\
sweat bead wetting the ribbons \
of time, and I wonder if da Vinci \
and Mona Lisa and Benedict Arnold and Shaq \
and Dolly Parton are my children. \
But then I wonder \
what’s happened in the future \
that I would want such an escape, \
but mostly I wonder \
what happens to my wife.

I’m cold, but I don’t think \
it’s because I’m still \
at the refrigerator. \
I need to stop before I form \
a new, terrible reality \
that I can’t be certain doesn’t exist \
until her car pulls in the driveway\
and I know I can open the apartment door\
without disintegrating.
