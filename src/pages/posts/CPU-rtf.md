To-do list:

\-Take out garbage  
\-Call Walgreens about debt collector calls  
\-Pick up eggs, beer, syrup, bananas  
\-Wash dark-delicates  
\-Call landlord about ants and silverfish  
\-INTERCEPT MARCUS AND THE ORION DEVICE

That last one strikes me as odd   
because I don’t know   
a Marcus   
and don’t remember   
writing it on the list.

Maybe…  
it was a helpful   
prophetic ghost,   
or a dimensional or cosmic   
entity with business here   
but no concept of appropriate   
social graces,   
or myself, a happenstance   
time traveler.   
These reasons   
I could understand.

That last one strikes me,  
and I bet my future self   
has slept with lots   
all over history, a gyrating  
sweat bead wetting the ribbons   
of time, and I wonder if da Vinci   
and Mona Lisa and Benedict Arnold and Shaq   
and Dolly Parton are my children.   
But then I wonder   
what’s happened in the future   
that I would want such an escape,   
but mostly I wonder   
what happens to my wife.

I’m cold, but I don’t think   
it’s because I’m still   
at the refrigerator.   
I need to stop before I form   
a new, terrible reality   
that I can’t be certain doesn’t exist   
until her car pulls in the driveway  
and I know I can open the apartment door  
without disintegrating.
