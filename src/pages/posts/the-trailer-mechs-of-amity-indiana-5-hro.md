The armor was giving way and turning black from all the blast scorching. His trailer mech took a knee, and thirty seconds later took another. He tried to get up but was knocked flat on his back by some green concussion bomb. He kept laying out a spread of hellfire even as his driver pod lights began to dim.

I couldn’t think in words, only pictures. Maybe adrenaline does that. Maybe some things are beyond language. I saw Mom’s face before and after the hospital. Dad’s smile when he caught me doing something I thought I’d be in trouble for but had somehow made him proud of me. Me and Dad eating a giant bucket of popcorn at the Bunker Hill Drudge-In. 

I didn’t realize what I was doing until I was already doing it. I rerouted systems and repair protocols I didn’t know I knew how to reroute, and got just enough juice for one last thrust. Taking a quick deep breath, I slammed the throttle down and knocked Dad’s mech sideways a good 30 yards. My whole body felt like it was realizing a bad idea, with most of the pain shooting from my right shoulder to across my chest. Before I could get my head back on straight, I was pummeled by the heavy fire meant for Dad. 

It wasn’t going to end well. I clung to the hope that this would only be the case for one of us. People needed Dad. They believed in him. I was scared but ready to find out what everything‘s been for. Whether it’s dark, empty nothing or something great and beautiful. I rerouted systems again, sacrificing any remaining mobility to reinforce defenses and hold out long enough for Dad to escape. A few minutes tops, and I’m hoping he’s not too stubborn to make the most of it. I hucked the last bit of my zap shield near where he landed to make sure he couldn’t come back. He could stay and watch or get away, and I was praying to whatever that he wasn’t feeling as dumb as I'd begun feeling. 

I’m was able to throw up an arc of my last explosive rounds to buy a little more time. Munitions reserves were scant. The main chassis was groaning louder and louder until I heard a sharp crack sound. I breathed deep and closed my eyes. My body relaxed into the pod harness. I was ready.

A sound like high-pitched thunder ripped through the air. A distant *plunk* followed by a brief whistle and then deeper boom rang out. It shook the ground, but not as much as I thought it should. ‘The fuck is happening, I thought. I craned my head up as far as I could and saw a shape far off near the park. It was coming my way.
