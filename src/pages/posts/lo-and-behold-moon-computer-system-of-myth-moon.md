Moon Computer was thought to be a myth for some time. It was like Bigfoot for programmers—nobody had ever seen it, but everyone had distant cousin, a random tech industry contact from Silicon Valley, or knew people who *knew people* who had seen it. Information on any confirmed locations, origins, purpose, or abilities is sparse at best, and even then of questionable validity.

A few years ago, the reported sightings gradually started to rise. Some even had photographic evidence. No one knows why, but a simple explanation is that the advancements in camera technology, smartphones, etc., and the subsequent proliferation of such devices, made it easier to capture evidence. And a growing population means there are less places where the Moon Computer could go unnoticed. 

Not everyone is satisfied with this explanation, however, for a few different reasons. One of the leading arguments is that when comparing recent sighting data with what past sighting data is available, according to some longtime students of the sighting data, the math just doesn't add up. Smartphone technology and population growth could account for some increase in sighting reports. However, if the Moon Computer's activity has continued at the same level, the degree to which sightings increased would, or *should*, follow a fixed ratio, more or less. 

If the number of sightings has increased above this fixed ratio, to a certain degree, it means that something has changed. Something beyond more people inhabiting the earth, and beyond more people having cameras with them at all times.
