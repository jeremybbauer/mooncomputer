Jesse Gibson realized the sound had stopped before his sight returned from the flood of light. He blinked over and over, hoping it wasn’t permanent and to quicken any recovery. As he went to call out to Angel Baby, he held the breath in his throat. He didn’t want to waste any surprise he may have in case the butcher at the altar was still focused on himself.

“I don’t know what you like to be called. What do you like to be called?” The voice boomed from ahead. Jesse recognized the voice, but not the tone. 

“I understand you may having many different feelings at once. For the moment, I’ll use the only name I know for you: the Nuclear Man. If you prefer something else, please let me know.”

Jesse stayed quiet. He tried to relax his tensing muscles to conceal his plotting mind. He focused on his breathing, on keeping it calm while his eyesight moved from blindness to blur.
