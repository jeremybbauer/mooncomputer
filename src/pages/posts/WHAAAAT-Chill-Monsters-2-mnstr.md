“Yo Diega, wanna do burgers?”

“Yeah.”

“What are you doing?”

“Hot or Not Yoga. I’m killin’ it. Wait, did you say burgers? What about Oochie’s Pizza?”

“YEEEESSSS, oh my god,” whispered Estelle, through clenched teeth and throat. “I need some wasabi breadsticks or I am going. To. Die. Right. Here. On. The. Floor…Blood spasm.”

“I know, uuuugh. Let’s do it. I’ll text Gary. Does leaving the apartment mean I have to wear a bra?”

“You do you, mama.”

Percy’s kinda cute, but he gets into some dumb shit. I don’t think I should get involved with someone like that. I hope this is over soon so I can finish up my *Skyrim* and *Torchlight* mods tonight. And maybe *Catfish* with Diega.

Oh, man, I wish I had my notebook, but…I just figured out how to make *Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* in *Fallout*! Shit, that’s gonna be good.

I should see Mom and Dad next week. Or maybe this weekend. Oh, but we need to find Percy first. Shit, how long have I been in my head? Looks like we’ve walked…three blocks. Phew! Probably no one noticed. Diega always notices.

I wonder if it sucks that she can see ghosts or if it’s rad. Probably sucks. There’s too much going on in this plane without these unlife .gif people replaying the shittiest parts of their lives in front of you, or if they’re the woke-up ghosts, just being super bored chatty dicks. But maybe I should build something to see other planes…There’s probably some cool ones. Maybe Dad has some old goggles I can have and some other hardware…Oh! I need to see if Mom still has some spare SSDs and her old X299 motherboard.
