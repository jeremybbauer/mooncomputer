There were stories about the baseball diamond. It rested at the bottom of a slope that reached right up against the road. A car could careen easily down and on through the whole thing, cutting tracks through the middle of the diamond as it’s pulled into the black void of the woods beyond. Some say this happened once, but couldn’t remember when or to whom. Most of the stories about the baseball diamond concerned what happened at night, the time that the void bled into the diamond, the town.

When parents find religion, it’s always bad news for the children no matter what the religion is. Almost never is it a slow trickle of accepting new doctrines or practices into their hearts and homes. It’s a vast wave they stand in front of, and when it breaks, it does so onto those around them with just as much force. Children can’t help where they stand.

At school, other children measured each others reactions as they spread the rumor of satanic rituals being performed in the woods beside the baseball diamond. Of sacrifices. They would say these things under arched eyebrows while they scanned for signs of fear or surprise. A direct hit would result in the storyteller growing just a little taller to make room for the new wisdom and capacity for knowledge. Having lost this battle and seeing the growth before them, the flinching party would shrink, just a little, and this effect could only be counteracted by retelling and winning over another.

However, one child was immune.
