Small clumps of fur and more blood led back to the arcade cabinet we’d moved. The trail was dotted by smears in a few places. I walked and breathed slow, making my way to the cabinet. I could hear something wet being pulled and chewed. I wasn’t looking at my feet, and slipped on one of the soaked fur clumps. After I stumbled and caught myself from falling, the wet sounds stopped.

I stayed still for a moment. I don’t know why I wanted to see it, but I did. I started walking again, trying to be even quieter than before. The wet sounds didn’t return. When I was within five feet of the arcade cabinet, I heard something dart towards the back of the room. I craned my neck to try to see what it was, but I couldn’t. I could hear something sniffing, though, and light taps on the linoleum floor. 

There was quiet again for a minute. Another slip on the floor blood made my shoe squeak. Rustling sounds came from the side of the room in short bursts like a careful panic. I bent down and gently slipped my feet out of my shoes. I almost missed a yellow eye locked onto me from between a few arcade cabinets and chairs as I was standing back up. It stared and held me there. Somehow being seen relaxed me. I didn’t want to disturb our moment together. 

The eye bobbed in and out of focus with more sniffing sounds. When it returned, I stayed fixed on it just like before. I wanted to offer to hold this space and time forever for us. I was disappointed when the eye disappeared and I was left staring into the small dark vacancy. Even when I heard the rustling further along the wall, I stared at the same spot in case it came back. 

A sharp clang rang out when the thing along the wall bumped into a cardboard box that bumped into two chairs that were stacked on top of each other. Whoever closed this place down took the time to stack things, but like an dickhead. The metal chair legs bounced hard and loud, and sent the thing bolting towards the door. 

It was a graceful blur of orange, red, and gray, even when it too slipped on the blood. Its three other legs carried it through the door gap and I was left alone in the bloody, all but dark abandoned arcade. 

I went over to the cabinet we’d moved, and found one of the rabbits from before all opened up. I felt sad for it. I wanted to pick it up, but I was afraid it would fall apart in my hands. The room felt too raw. I wanted to leave, but didn’t feel like I could. I wondered if the other rabbit was opened up somewhere too or if it was out having its life.
