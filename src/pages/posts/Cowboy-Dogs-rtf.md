I tried to fill your trailer with glass lilies\
but stopped, seeing the shark fetus \
jar. Something didn’t feel right. So \
I took a drink of Yoohoo infused gin \
and examined the fetus. It looked gummy.\
It looked like it wanted teeth pressed into it\
and also to complete its yawn. I grabbed the green \
bowl from your cabinet and noticed you’ve kept \
everything the same and filled the bowl \
with my chocolate gin and set one lily afloat \
in the brown pool. You’ll find it between \
the shark fetus and that cowboy statue we got \
at the truck stop with chicken fingers and coffee\
and the crystal cherries and Jesus. I hope you \
remember that the best parts of life \
are the stupid things. I hope you still live\
for the dumb shit. I don’t see the dog, \
so I guess she got too old and those bulges\
were filled with millions of tiny death. In \
the cabinet where the bowl was you’ll find \
one chocolate gin recipe, titled Chocolate Pine Baron, \
one Cowboy Dogs recipe, and one Hulk Hogan\
figurine that’s been painted to look like bigfoot. \
My grandpa Donald died. Beneath the shark fetus \
you’ll find a prayer card from his funeral and \
my new work number. Please call me \
if you have any trouble with the recipes \
or what sort of wars Hulkfoot would battle.
