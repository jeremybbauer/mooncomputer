I tried to fill your trailer with glass lilies  
but stopped, seeing the shark fetus   
jar. Something didn’t feel right. So   
I took a drink of Yoohoo infused gin   
and examined the fetus. It looked gummy.  
It looked like it wanted teeth pressed into it  
and also to complete its yawn. I grabbed the green   
bowl from your cabinet and noticed you’ve kept   
everything the same and filled the bowl   
with my chocolate gin and set one lily afloat   
in the brown pool. You’ll find it between   
the shark fetus and that cowboy statue we got   
at the truck stop with chicken fingers and coffee  
and the crystal cherries and Jesus. I hope you   
remember that the best parts of life   
are the stupid things. I hope you still live  
for the dumb shit. I don’t see the dog,   
so I guess she got too old and those bulges  
were filled with millions of tiny death. In   
the cabinet where the bowl was you’ll find   
one chocolate gin recipe, titled Chocolate Pine Baron,   
one Cowboy Dogs recipe, and one Hulk Hogan  
figurine that’s been painted to look like bigfoot.   
My grandpa Donald died. Beneath the shark fetus   
you’ll find a prayer card from his funeral and   
my new work number. Please call me   
if you have any trouble with the recipes   
or what sort of wars Hulkfoot would battle.
