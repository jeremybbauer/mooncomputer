at times, light seems \
an elemental form all its own. \
sometimes its state holds a liquidity,\
sometimes it appears part gas. \
light, in its far reaching and traveling \
nature, represents a hope that our \
present form is only a step\
in our natural progression, \
or ascendency.

midmorning, october 1993,\
my home is sold to a man\
who slaughtered our chickens\
after he’d found all their eggs,\
and another fed me my pet rabbit \
without telling me \
and though I never heard \
the screams, they’ve echoed \
within my body, \
waiting.

- - -

too often my body \
feels clippy yet graceful \
like a digital swan\
like the synergy\
between lamb and \
steak knife.

in the backscatter of luminous \
night, the universe was revealed\
to be a diagram of an appaloosa\
skull in the lite brite of a haunted \
attic apartment.

darkness holds its own safety. \
it hides all things, and can reveal \
more than the brightest screen. \
the darkness holds an energy, \
realized by scared boys who’s \
buzzards always pick in the light \
of day.

as my vessel reentered\
the atmosphere i was\
coming to the robotic\
warnings until everything\
started shaking so hard\
my head hit the floor and\
i was enveloped in light.

dawn, 1991, my father’s packing\
away the last of his things \
that aren’t me in Chiquita banana\
boxes. I run down gravel pleading \
something, trying to say all houses \
contain doors of fleshy thunder\
that interrupt _toxic crusaders_, \
and all houses from this point on \
will contain one cracked yolk \
of a boy dripping through \
the carpet, becoming the \
basement.
