at times, light seems   
an elemental form all its own.   
sometimes its state holds a liquidity,  
sometimes it appears part gas.   
light, in its far reaching and traveling   
nature, represents a hope that our   
present form is only a step  
in our natural progression,   
or ascendency.

midmorning, october 1993,  
my home is sold to a man  
who slaughtered our chickens  
after he’d found all their eggs,  
and another fed me my pet rabbit   
without telling me   
and though I never heard   
the screams, they’ve echoed   
within my body,   
waiting.

* * *

too often my body   
feels clippy yet graceful   
like a digital swan  
like the synergy  
between lamb and   
steak knife.

* * *

in the backscatter of luminous   
night, the universe was revealed  
to be a diagram of an appaloosa  
skull in the lite brite of a haunted   
attic apartment.

* * *

darkness holds its own safety.   
it hides all things, and can reveal   
more than the brightest screen.   
the darkness holds an energy,   
realized by scared boys who’s   
buzzards always pick in the light   
of day.

* * *

as my vessel reentered  
the atmosphere i was  
coming to the robotic  
warnings until everything  
started shaking so hard  
my head hit the floor and  
i was enveloped in light.

* * *

dawn, 1991, my father’s packing  
away the last of his things   
that aren’t me in Chiquita banana  
boxes. I run down gravel pleading   
something, trying to say all houses   
contain doors of fleshy thunder  
that interrupt *toxic crusaders*,   
and all houses from this point on   
will contain one cracked yolk   
of a boy dripping through   
the carpet, becoming the   
basement.
