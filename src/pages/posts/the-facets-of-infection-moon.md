Yesterday Talulah was testing the effects of the new compound on those with stage 3 infection. Once again the reaction seemed outside of normal parameters. The subject’s arms sprouted some sort of pink crystalline structures that weren’t fragile or painful, according to the subject, but also didn’t stem the infection. Today Talulah is breaking into her own facility with Sam, whose face was distorted from the weird, askew grin she gets whenever her manipulations prove successful. 

Sam has a talent for keying into those things people want to do but fear, conscience, concepts of basic goodness, etc., keep them only gazing into the unknown. She studies you to find your fulcrum. A scientist herself, she makes subtle, calculated prods to find where exerting force will execute the optimal push into the canyon of the blue-black beyond. So far, her hypothesis about Talulah’s fulcrum was all but confirmed: her estranged mother. 

Any movement toward her mother propelled Talulah in the opposite direction down to the most minute preferences. So much so that over time, only the idea of moving towards or in likeness to her mother ignited response instead of any real mobility in such a direction. Sam didn’t expect it to be something so simple as familial rebellion with Talulah. It was so common a catalyst and Sam had been disappointed it wasn’t something more unique. But that’s the mistake with pedestals, she learned, they’re never as sturdy as they appear to be.
