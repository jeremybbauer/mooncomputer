So, what does Alexei do with this iridescent, impossible element? He puts it in a computer. 

While Alexei no longer thought the oneirite was part of a druidic divining spoon, he was still convinced it could connect him with the unseen world. With the internet starting to grow at that time, the first search engines starting their threshing bloom, Alexei’s years of experience building and using computers, and his confidence in his technical aptitude, Alexei reasoned that transcendental experiments with computers offered an environment he could control with limitless possibilities. He spent half his life—past and present—on computers, knew his own inside and out, and was sure he’d detect any anomaly too weird and could shut down the system immediately. Such is the great danger of the modern world: the hyper confidence of men faced with things of which they have no real knowledge or experience, unaware of why they do all the deadly things that they do.

Alexei really was a fantastic engineer, but he wasn’t creating engineering problems. And he didn’t have any real experience to draw from concerning the arcane or inter-planar. His secret Setianism business wasn’t even really the occult. It was more of a social club, just people standing around, obeying a fun/silly dress code, and trying to convince themselves and each other that they were profound and mystical. Preventative medicine for a boredom implosion. The effects of building a substance from another world into something from this world can't be predicted. There’s no way to know how the two will react to one another, but there's a good chance it won't be good.
