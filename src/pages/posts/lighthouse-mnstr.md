It appeared over the waves, floating in the middle of the dark vastness just above the water. A tremendous noise seemed to come from all directions. It looked around, but couldn’t see anything. It started to feel afraid. Then it looked down and could see the water moving, with small strips of light rolling to each rough rhythm. 

Before it could feel relieved, it realized it didn’t know how it got there. It looked around again, searching for anything that might help. As it searched, a small flash of light appeared in the distance. It started towards the light, only for the flash to fade and return the landscape to darkness. It sank lower, touching the water for a moment before floating up again. The wetness and chill, though brief, were unpleasant for the circumstances. 

The water held the only sound and light again. It started to feel scared, alone. But then the light appeared again. Excited, it started towards it, only for the light to fade away once more. It felt frightened again. It wasn’t sure what to do. Panic began cresting over top of it when the light returned again. 

This time it watched the light close, and found that the light faded away once more and then returned again. It watched as the light faded and returned two more times. It realized that the light was constant, not fleeting as it had feared, and was overjoyed. Focusing on the new rhythm of the light, it started again through the darkness. The times in dark still felt scary, but it kept moving forward, knowing that though the light fades away, it always returns.
