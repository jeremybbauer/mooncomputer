![glitched house at night with one light on and trees in front](https://res.cloudinary.com/mooncomputer/image/upload/c_scale,h_800,q_auto:best/v1568773028/Moon%20Computer%20Blog/MNSTR/WHAAAAT%20Chill%20Monsters/whaaaat-chill-monsters-10--fabrice-villard-BWN9C9EdbNM-unsplash--glitched-2.jpg "WHAAAAT Chill Monsters 10")

The last light of day waned as the five approached Diega and Estelle’s rented house. All except the frozen and suspended ghost squinted trying to make out the form laying in a heap on the porch. 

“Hey! Percy?” shouted Gary.

Gary ran to the porch while Ear Medicine lunged forward to take Gary’s place guiding the ghost. When Ear Medicine remembered Gary wasn’t holding the ghost up, only applying light pressure to make the ghost float forward, he was relieved to see no one was paying attention.

Gary shook Percy’s shoulders.

“Hey. Percy. Come on, man. What’s going on?” The lump that was Percy gave no signs of consciousness. Leaning in to shake what was hopefully his little brother some more, Gary stepped on the side on Percy’s leg on accident, pinching a small amount of skin between his shoe and the mustard yellow boards of the porch. 

Percy’s torso shot up and looked straight ahead, opposite from Gary and everyone else. 

“If it’s not Percy, kill it, Gary” shouted Estelle.

“It’s him. Percy, hey. You alright? Talk to me.”

Before Gary could react, Percy darted past him towards the side of the house, still not seeming to notice anyone or anything. Though the side of the house was in shadow, something of great volume and water content was erupting from Percy in heaves and groans as he kneeled on the ground, sometimes throwing a hand up to use the house as support. 

“Is he puking blood?” asked Estelle.

“No,” said Gary, “It’s blue. And kind of glowing.”

“Well, I’ve never seen your blood. He’s acting weird. Are you sure it’s not blood?”

Gary felt like he was at an intersection on a four-lane road. Every route looking the same, not able to make out what’s in the distance of any of them. 

“Hey, P. Come on, what’s going on?” pleaded Gary.

After a final retch, Percy was breathing like he’d just ran a marathon. As he sat back in the strip of grass behind him, his head turned towards his brother slow like a stone wheel turning in place. 

“You’re gonna want to sit a little to the left. Oh, shit. I mean my left, your right,” said Gary.
