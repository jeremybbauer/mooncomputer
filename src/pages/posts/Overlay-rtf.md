I’m a distant light on the highway.

I can’t tell what I’m supposed to do.

All unsuccessful: my horse farm,  
rat farm, computer farm, my   
tarantula farm. The pastures  
are all piss-mud, ragweed, junk code,  
and void holes.

The lawn is covered with splayed  
microwave burritos and beer cans  
in a pentagram.   
A face bursting with light   
screams on the horizon  
& screams  
& screams  
blanketing shadow over everything  
that isn’t its head.

The pastures and light create   
a cacophony of the above and below.   
It’s the sound of the present system,   
a sheet of artificial architecture built   
by chittering hands like awkward   
spiders of basement gods.

You can feel the overlay  
in the woods, in the water,  
in the dark.
