Then came the third wave. Their tactics took a 180° so hard the fuckers must’ve been desperate. No more hiding. No more messing with the minds of us park folk. The third wave was a hellfire blitz we didn’t expect. But we were prepared for it anyhow.

By this time, the rest of the Rosewater Court Mobile Home Park were worn down to nubs inside. Wet and tired souls. They’d been shown all their regrets and all of their unmet dreams till any fight was gone from their bones. While a force needling flyers and plasma-shooting speeders descended, the people of the park watched from under the 1970s lace curtains on their trailer windows, barely reacting to the carnage landscaping our home.

Dad took this the hardest. Seeing his neighbors in their homes just waiting for whatever was coming seemed worse to him than seeing Momma only lose her again minutes later. The weirdo machines were flying towards us, setting off Dad’s alarms, and for a minute he stared at the ground then up at the sky. I’m not sure what he was thinking about. I know my eyes begged him to fortify, and also tell me what the hell we were gonna do. Then he turned to me and said, “Son, it’s you and me. Just like always, against the tides and the fear and the heartache. I’m scared as shit of these things. So whaddya say we throw some of that fear right back at these shitters.”

“Love you, Dad,” I said. “Let’s fuck ‘em up!”

Dad let out a big laugh and said, “Love you too, son. *Yeee-haw*!” 

“Hey, S.W.E.L.L.?,” I said. “Fuck-Em-Up Mode **activate**.”
