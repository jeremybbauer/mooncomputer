If I have to listen to Daryl go on about his dragon statues again I’m gonna hurl in his plants again. I’m not in the mood today, but my car’s dead again so here I am in Randy’s home forest of wood paneling, green carpet, and the smell of old fry oil.

“Hey, bud. You want some chicken fingers? They’re a little cold, but they’re spicy buffalo, so. Evens out.”

“Daryl, no thank you. Can we get to the library now, man? I gotta check my LiveJournal to see if Carla has anywhere to go for New Year’s.”

The black orb on Daryl’s gun rack catches my periphery again. It spins forever and sounds like blindness. I think I can feel the spinning happening behind my eyes, scraping against the sides of my skull. The sound and feeling are all there is, maybe for days or years, maybe forever.

I hear air rushing into my eardrums and I’m out of the loop. Dammit. Two minutes this time. I’d ask Daryl about the thing but I’ve asked him before and I can’t remember what he said because he talked about it forever and I tuned out, and I just can’t today. I’m hungover and it’s the last day of 1999. It’s a new goddamn century and this one’s not going to be shitty. Not for me.

“Dang, you spaced out again, bud. I said you can use my ‘puter to check your LiveJournal.”

“Daryl. No thank you. Can we please go to the library where they have computers that are not covered in spicy buffalo sauce and crispy chicken crumbs?”

“Heh, yeah. Okay, bud.”

We ride into the piss stain of a morning sky in Daryl’s mold green Cutlass. The air from the rolled down windows is helping my head. I close my eyes for a second but open them again fast. I don’t want to trigger another loop or whatever. I think I need some Gatorade and seven Slim Jim’s. Maybe a snowball.
