There are, mostly, two kinds of ghosts: the lucid, Patrick Swayze types that are aware of themselves and their surroundings, and the type that functions like a bad GIF made manifest, stuck in their own tragic and/or boring loop in time. The bulk of the world’s ghost population is the latter, so don’t feel bad if you’ve been at this pottery wheel for five hours and there's still no sign of Biff or Judy or whomever was supposed to join you and show that kiln what hot really is, and now the clay’s just dry and, now that you think about it, kind of smells. You may have to settle for phantom vacuuming sounds, never having closed cabinet doors again, and your bed lifting up and down, but that’s where the ghost action in the bedroom ends, I’m afraid. 

These GIF-style ghosts go through the same motions they did in life, whatever was routine and important to them in some way. We now have people dying for whom a major part of the their lives was lived on the internet. Someone, I forget who, said: “The screen has become the most important place in the world,” and unless people stopped dying around when Facebook and clickbait came into existence, the screen has become the most important place to the new dead as well as the living. 

These user ghosts are still looping, so you may have encountered them but mistook them for spam, or bots, or an account hack. Also, have you ever argued with someone on Twitter or in some comments section and they seemed to say the same thing over and over or aren't responding at all to anything you’ve said? Sometimes, those people are just dicks. Other times, you’re interfacing with a ghost loop of the information age. Sorry. As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, as the world changes, so too does the unseen sphere.

For the most part, these e-ghosts are annoying but harmless. However, hackers die too, and sometimes return to loop as well. I used to operate a sort of consultancy where I encountered a Turkish hacker amassing piles of cryptocurrency and people’s personal data from a number of sites, which this hacker-ghost would then sell on the dark web for more cryptocurrency. This was all from repeating one small part of their everyday routine from life, so automated that it may as well have been a bot. Once I identified what was happening, all that was needed was to update to the latest software and versions, betting that these things were released after the hacker had died. Loop ghosts can’t learn. They can’t think and can only repeat previous thought.

After the ghost was rendered ineffective, it still followed the loop. The tried the same data routes every day and still posted to the dark web, but all their posts were blank now that they couldn’t get anything. After a few months, the attempts and posts stopped altogether. I’ve always wondered what happened. I hope they were somehow able to finish whatever business they had left, found peace, and moved on. If we can’t catch a fucking break in life, we damn well deserve one in death. 

Peace be with you, Turkish hacker. To everyone else, change your damn passwords. A barely functioning ghost can hack you. And the internet’s bad enough without being haunted there too.
