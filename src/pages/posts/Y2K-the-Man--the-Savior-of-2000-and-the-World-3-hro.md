Daryl sucks down antacids in the car as I take a pull from the vodka. For some reason I feel disappointed after the swig. Something doesn’t feel right. Like something’s missing.

I think about having some of the Jaeger, but I’ll wait till I feel desperate. Last time I had that stuff I puked black and it looked like hell was coming out of me. I don’t know Deshawn super well, so I’m not taking any more pulls until we’re inside.

I wonder if Deshawn and Carla are together, then I wonder why I wonder that, then decide I don’t care about anything. It’s the kind of loop I’m used to, so that’s kind of good. Sometimes there’s a flash in my head of a computer on fire or a pixelated image of fire on a computer screen. Sometimes other things are on fire. I get other flashes of nothingness, a void of pitch dark but there’s something alive about it, like a subtle movement but I can’t tell if it’s really there. Who knows if it’s a weird thing or just me being paranoid.

I take another small sip of the vodka and I hate it, so me and Daryl head to the door. There’s, like, seven or ten people there and I don’t know most of ’em. Carla’s got her hair in these little bun horns and her brother’s JNCOs. Deshawn dresses like a nerd but somehow he’s cool about it. I always thought he looked kind of like a pug in the face too, but also somehow in a cool way. I can tell I’m thinking too much.

Daryl says, “‘Ey, Carla. Deshawn. Howsit goin’?” I’m busy trying to shut the screen door without it slamming on me and making me look a doofus.

“It’s good, man. Yeah, it’s real good. Welcome to my place,” says Deshawn.

“Oh, yeah, hey, man. How’s , uh…here’s the Jaeger,” I say, looking down at my own dumb hand holding the bottle. I’ve done worse.

“Nice! Thanks, man! You wanna do a bomb, or…?”

“Nah, maybe later. I got vodka too, here.”

Carla says, “Hell, yeah! You go, boy!” Carla loves vodka. She loves everything. I think she’s the only person in my life that hugs me. Daryl’s tried but I dodge him hard, but I let Carla hug me hello and good-booze right now. It’s nice and I don’t feel nervous, but that doesn’t last long.

“You want some with pop or something, or straight shots, like…”

“Um, um, uuuuhh. Hmm. Ummmmm…” I blank out for a second. It might be my regular thing, I don’t know. I sink back into my head and see the computer fire from before, both of them, and the void and the orb too. But they’re all for split seconds this time. Is it happening or am I just remembering it, or just thinking about it?

“All of it,” I say out loud, breaking free.

“Fucking all. Right. Man! Let’s go! Daryl, you in,” says Carla.

“Inna sec, prob’ly. My belly’s stuffed with tacos and fries right at the moment.”

“Alright. Good on you. Knowing yourself.”

Carla throws Daryl a peace sign and pours me and her shots. We throw them back and I hate them, but I like being with Carla. She’s sparkle in a dumb world.

She gets me a grape pop to make a drink. I remember that time in high school I drank so much Canadian whiskey and grape pop and whiskey and threw up and it was so close to black I thought I was dying because I forgot I’d been drinking grape. It’s an odd thing to give a shit about, but I don’t wanna throw up dark tonight, but I don’t say anything to Carla and I make my drink too strong. Maybe it’s for the best. This brosky needs to chill.

“Hey, you all, let’s take this to the basement,” says Deshawn.
