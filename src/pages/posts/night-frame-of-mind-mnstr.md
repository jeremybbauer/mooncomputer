Sometimes people would ask, “What kind of record store is only open at night?” Helen always said it was a mood she was going for. There were fairy lights, just enough neon kitsch to be fun and not look like a bar. And the customers at night were more interesting. Take Burt, for instance. He was a retired cop trying to pare down the number of nights he spent drinking by browsing old country and pop records a few times a week instead. There was Jermaine, whom she sometimes had to wrangle out the door at closing time because he could talk for hours about both Dolly Parton and punk rock. And then there was Clyde. 

Clyde had long brown hair, gray eyes, and looked to be in her early to mid twenties. She liked to come in around 1 AM. Her tastes ran pretty wide, but she was always most interested to see what the newest music was. She liked to talk about trends, how cyclical they were. When she was excited to find a record, she’d say, “Oh, boy!” or “Gol-lly!” and other customers often thought she must be from a small town or a farm or something. 

One night, three drunk bros knocked down a shelf and smashed a few records stumbling in the calamity. Clyde shot a glare in their direction and they seemed locked in place. They didn’t speak or move. Clyde said, “Leave money for the records. Plus a hundred bucks for the trouble.” Their clumsy movements turned fluid and automatic as they took out their wallets, then placed the bills on the floor in front of them. “Now go home,” said Clyde, turning back to the records she’d been flipping through. “If you come here again, you’ll be found gutted and strewn amongst the trees outside. Eaten by the birds and flies.” The boys filed out the shop door, calm as glass. As Clyde helped clean up, she said to Helen with a smile, “Sorry if that was scary. Sometimes you just have to know how to handle people.”
