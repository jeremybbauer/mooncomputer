Alexei thought he was buying a druidic divination spoon from the 1st century BCE. Relatively tame, but Alexei was jazzed. When he got it home late at night after the auction and went to secret away his great new magical spoon, before leaving the driveway to enter his house, the bowl (open part) fell off without any impetus, leaving just a dumb, flat brass-colored bar in Alexei’s hand. His heart sank, and anger and gloom bubbled to his surface like indigestion. He threw the spoon handle to the ground and paced and paced shaking his head in passive rage for being swindled in such a blatant way. Then he noticed the glow.

He picked up the handle and saw there were scratches from him throwing it against the concrete. Faint light emanated from these scratches, and he took it to be a glare from his house’s porch light, but found that the handle’s light remained even if he cupped his hands over it and no matter the angle he held the handle. 

We now know that what was attached to the front of the spoon was just a piece from a rusted old spoon with carvings in the rust to make it look all ceremonial and druid-y, stuck to the handle with superglue, with the whole thing spray-painted brown with a coat of brass-colored paint on top. It’s still unknown, though, who put the thing up for auction or if they knew what they had.
