Dear Diary,

Ooooh, man. Rory taught me this phrase yesterday. I texted him about this guy who yelled at me for stepping on his coffee and he said I shoulda told the guy to suck shit. I’ve been going nuts with it. I’ve been all, “Suck shit, you birds!” “Suck shit, you boner drones!” “Suck shit, dump-truck dick!” It makes me feel like a Johnny Cage, I don’t know why. Man. The sun looks a little brighter today. I’ve been hyped up all day. I don’t know what it is. Yeah, I’ve had some caffeine, and Dale bet me five bucks I couldn’t shotgun three Pepsis and I fuckin’ did it, but that’s not it! I just have a good feeling about today. I’m a mothafuckin’ eagle today, Diary. Fuckin’ flamin’ deer-horse with bat wings and all kinds of cool and terrifying shit. If I had to have my stomach pumped, lightning would shoot out and give everyone erections. Bad erections. Phew. I’m gonna lie down.

Bye, Diary.

P.S. I found a rap lyric in a notebook from 5th grade today. It goes, “I’m smokin’ so much pot, you’ll think your kitchen’s been robbed.” I’m glad I stopped rapping.
