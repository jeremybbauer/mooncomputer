“Haven’t you ever wanted to be part of something?” 

“Yes. A dance dance revolution. But it turned out to just be nerds dancing bad in public. Not dancing, but like...I don’t know. Like hyper line dancing.”

“My cousin lost a ton of weight doing that.”

“If that makes him happy, then...whatever. But he still can’t dance.”

“Yeah. This one time he got real confident that the DDR dancing would translate to actual dancing. It was heartbreaking.”

“I remember that. I had to leave because I thought he was going to get arrested with that intense face he was making and that, like, noodle-leg frenzy. And because they were out of breadsticks.”

“He was flying that day. Until the dancing.”

“Were you asking me something?”

“Um. Oh, yeah. We’re starting this thing I heard about online. It’s a tech coven where you, like, do rituals and, like, spells and shit with computers and drink a lot of wine. Basically what we do now, but with people.”

“Ugh. The ‘with people’ part isn’t really selling me. The no-people thing is kind of the best part about what we do now.”

“Yeah, well…There aren’t any cute boys, or cute girls for you, when it’s just you and me. Except for me. And you.”

“Uggghhhhh. I think we need some time apart.”

“Come on, just try it with me. If it sucks, we’ll ditch and I’ll buy you nachos. With all the guac.”

“…Okay, Marcus, but don’t say ‘all the guac’ unless you really mean all the guac. Because I mean it. I’m gonna eat all of it. It’s going be disgusting and…heaven.”

“I know you. I know.”
