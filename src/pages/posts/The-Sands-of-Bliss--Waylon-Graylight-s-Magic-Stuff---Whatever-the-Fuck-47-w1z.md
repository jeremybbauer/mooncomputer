Divine aspects vary, just as a general rule. It all depends on how much of themselves the deity decides to give to make the aspect. The more they give, the more powerful and less autonomous. These end up being piloted husks for the most part, or like their avatars in this video game the rest of us call life. At the other end of the aspect spectrum are people or beings with just enough divine essence to have a pretty good life. They’re not sure why, but they’ve always felt just a little special. Things tend to work out for them, confidence comes easy, as does most everything. It’s kind of fucking rude.

Whether by accident, design, or foul play, it’s common for aspects to create items of power. In the late 1970s, an aspect of the god most know as the Bermuda Triangle that was somewhere in the middle of the aspect spectrum caught an elbow outside a club in Brooklyn and lost a tooth to the glistening sidewalk. This tooth was eventually found by four then cokeheads—Ricky, Tabby-J, Bots, and Jeong—who later turned into enlightened community leaders. Since the Bermuda Triangle is a god of transport, the tooth did exactly that. However, since a tooth is so small (this aspect passed for human, when they wanted to), there’s only so much oomph you can get out of it. It couldn’t transport a whole body, but a whole mind it could do.

It’s a little murky what the four did with the tooth at first or how they discovered its power, but what we do know is that they cut it in half, divided one half into four pieces, and ground the other half into a kind of sand. The individual, solid pieces are enough to transport your consciousness to other places, planes, etc. Just for a bit, and you can look around and hear things but not really interact (that is, as always, unless something powerful notices and interacts themselves).

With the tooth sand, it transports your consciousness, but only for such brief amounts of time that it doesn’t appear that anything happened at all except for the calm bliss that overtakes you. Somehow, with all that have used it, the sand only takes the user’s mind to a euphoric plane. The blissful feeling one gets when they rub the sand is the result of their mind visiting this heaven for between seconds.

So, it became know as the Sands of Bliss. It may be the one magical item, maybe the one thing in all of magic, that leaves people and the world better than it was before. The only sparkly, mystic thing I wouldn’t chuck into the goddamn sun if I could fucking reach it.

Since the sand is from an aspect of a god of transportation, the beautiful thing is that it never stays in one place too long. At some point the sand disappears and reappears somewhere else. I’ve only been fortunate enough to find it once, years ago, and I still think of it almost every night, when the dark comes and it’s me and the void. It stays with you through the void.

Good luck.
