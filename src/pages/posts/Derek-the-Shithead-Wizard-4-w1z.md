The day of battle was boss. My training in the woods was hard, shitty hard, but I’d honed everything I could. I was feeling like a flamethrower in a butter factory.

Like I was going to melt this motherfucker down.

I sent an evite to the battle to Janice and said sorry for writing “chode” in barbecue sauce on her sliding glass door. Normally I’d try to remind her that she sucked for standing me up, but that’s not zen, so I held it in. I am the tall ass tree and when the wind blows I only but sway. I sent evites to all of Derek’s friends, Randy, Gary, and everyone Derek’s ever cared about. I sent Derek a computer curse that put a permanent flaming middle finger on pile of skulls on his screen. I mixed in a laser charm so it etched itself on his bedroom wall too.

I waited for Derek in the pasture south of Oochi’s Pizza (I put up some nuh-uh wards on Oochi’s to keep that brilliant bastard safe). I waited and was the tree. People gathered and I was the tree.

Derek shuffled into the pasture in his dumb Adidas flip-flops and knock-off Oakley’s on the back of his neck. I yelled, “Why are you walking so slow?” He yelled back, “That’s my business.” It didn’t make sense and he’s the worst, but I was the tree. I was ready to attain the level of wizard.

Derek’s awful mouth said, “I’m already wizard level so this is dumb. I’m literally so good at this shit. This is a waste of my time, but fuck it.” Then he spit a loogie towards the grass but it hit his sandal. He tried to act like it didn’t happen and everyone looked like they felt awkward about him being so embarrassing.

I said, “Derek, I’m pretty zen right now…but you’re a wet garbage fire and I think everyone in this town deserves to see you cry. After I beat you in mage battle, I will have enough credits to be a wizard. I will ascend and you will be shamed. I thank you for your service.”

Derek said a rude “pfft” and whipped a smog bolt at me.

My levitations and slime forms are choice. I hovered up high over the bolt and slimed up as I dove at his dumb flip-flops and under, knocking him on his ass. My axe kick almost shot his head through the dirt, but he used his vermin stone to rat scurry away.

I did the hand signs for Sappho’s Total Darkness that turned the pasture to night. I heard a weird squeal and fired off Hepburn’s Moggy. Golden teeth of light streaked through the darkness. There was a loud hiss and then a yell from Derek as the teeth tossed him into the air. He’s fucking toast, I thought.

I heard a couple of thuds and then a red light started glowing near the sounds and I started running. The light got brighter and brighter, and right before I reached it, there was this loud “BOOMPH.” A flash of an wipe-away spell. I was on my ass.

I WASN’T THE TREE, I thought. No, wait. I wasn’t the tree…but I am the tree. Me and my space zen would turn me into the glitter-spark nova I knew I was.

I jumped to my feet while my eyes tried to focus. Derek said another rude, “Pfft,” and looked like a dirty smug sonuva bitch. The shit looked better with a rat face.

Derek summoned an iron mountain gorilla. For most this would be a game over, with its sick double left and right hooks. They bash but good. But I’d been practicing on them since I was 12, thanks to mom.

I hummed. Rubbed my palms in circular rhythms. Added a little Nae Nae. As I dropped my fists, I felt the charge of Niviane’s Chance and kicked the gorilla’s taint through the top of its skull.

I didn’t stop to breathe. I cheetah lunged dodging every miserable thing Derek flung at me — lightning orbs, Crowley’s Golden Shower, meth-fire bolts, diamond razor sprays, Keane’s Wave of Reversal. I didn’t stop until I was within dynamo roundhouse range and I just unleashed.

The grass beneath us disintegrated. Derek’s shitty ruby focus stone burst into Mars dust. Derek was left flat on his back realizing he was beat to shit by the baddest mage there ever fucking was.

Derek coughed some throaty shit. He was shaking a little and breathing hard. He looked up at me with the saddest watery look. I stood. As the tree.

Derek caught his breath but just laid there. He blurted out, “Sorry, sh-shit.” He said he was sorry about everything. That he’s a rotted dick (subtext) because he likes me.

I said, “Of course you like me, you cock tear. I’m hot, I can kick like a Megazord, and I beat pieces of shit like you at mage battles. I always knew you liked me and I didn’t give a shit, cause as a human, you choke it. That’s why you’re the worst. You thought you could, like, neg me or some weak shit hoping we’d twist cocks over it. And for that you have to die.”

I put my shoe on his throat. He looked like a scared trout about to have his spine ripped out.

I slid my shoe across his Adam’s apple to wipe the dirt off the sole and walked away. I didn’t look behind me, but I think I could hear stoked whispers saying, “she fuckin’ did it,” like they just saw a bald eagle jump a motorcycle over the grand canyon. And that’s exactly what they fuckin’ saw. Fuck you, Derek. The Trailer Mage has ascended.
