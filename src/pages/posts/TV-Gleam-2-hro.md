It isn’t instantaneous  
what happens to a boy  
stuck in a field of light

The brightness saturating  
everything whiteness without end

If he’s strong enough he’ll become  
static  
A frequency of light and darkness

The light path cools and fades. A man seizes and screams on the cold metal floor. His mind hasn’t caught up to his body. A desperate Jesse Gibson, the Nuclear Man, assumed a lot. That he’d found help, that the minutes between the signal he sent and the man’s appearance felt the same to the man.

Instead of years.
