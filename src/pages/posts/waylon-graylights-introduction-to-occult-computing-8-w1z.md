Alexei’s experiment created a computer that could access dreamspace and crawl the thought-plane to access people’s dreams. Dreams appeared as text readouts describing all the fantastic, horrifying, goofy, and sweat-hot events and details of people’s uncontrollable fantasies and fears in the Land of Nod, from what authorities and researchers have gathered. This was how it worked in the beginning, at least.

With planar artifacts, depending on their origin, a certain amount of bleed should always be expected. These artifacts can become focal points for planar disruption and begin to warp their surrounding environment. With Alexei’s dream computer, the warping started off rather light. A small unexplained noise here, quizzically misplaced car keys there. Stuff that happens in normal life all the time. Then Alexei could swear he could hear singing coming from the carpet in his sleep. 

Over a few days, whole societies formed from sentient fibers of carpet, then a caste system of high-pile versus low-pile strands. And as the first great carpet war in history was about to erupt between the High Burgundies of the Den and the nomadic Area Rugs of the Room Living, the voices disappeared in an instant, as if the terrible flooring decided on in decades past had never been anything more than lifeless seas of polyester and nylon. 

During this time, the oddest thing to Alexei was that his family didn’t seem to notice the \
invasion du surréalisme at all. Later, we’d find that they did indeed see all the same things as Alexei, but they kept it to themselves, convinced they were losing grip on reality and too afraid to mention it to anyone. The bleed didn’t end with the carpet, though, and they all would have their own manifestations and symptoms to face before long.
