Derek said if he had it his way, I wouldn’t be able to vote. I said that was a useless thing say because I can vote and nobody gives a shit what he would do if he was ruining the world. I also told him that him talking was worse air pollution than farts or bird flu.

The time will come.

I am a battle train of middle fingers and thunder blood. This world will feel my fuck-you’s and America-Online-disc razor storm.

I was stoked to get trained up good, but I think I have to give up on trainers. Janice choded out. She tried to unchode, but you know, it’s already been full choded. Laws of nature. Gary tried, but no bananas. Gary’s a mothman but he sucks at it. He can’t use his doom gaze without puking, and all I saw was some DUIs and me scissor kicking myself off a mountain. He ain’t his daddy. I kicked his mouth and punched his tit cause I thought we were going hard on it. I don’t think Gary knows hard. That downy motherfucker is beautiful, but he takes a punch like buckshot to a toad.

If I am to ascend like the wise velociraptor of darkness I know I am, I have to tell the world to sit and spin. I am Mandy Mage. I can do it.

Fuck Derek.

Tomorrow we battle.
