“I ever tell you how I got my name, kid?”

“No…but I think I can guess.”

“There I was, Florida, 1992. Tallahassee or somethin’…I don’t know, not one of the good towns. Anyway, so there I am while Dirk Scabbard’s War Swords—that’s what he called his guys, you know, his flunkies…bit much for me—they’re slashin’ in all around me. And they all got these electrified swords and boots with springs in ’em, so they’re all hopping around like, I don’t know, hell, like dynamite fleas. And I’m dodgin’ some, kickin’ some teeth, and shattered some of these sonsabitches’ swords. It’s real satisfyin’ when one’s comin’ right at ya and they think they got ya until bam, you move outta the way just in time so they land beside you and buh-bam, you knock their smug faces clear across the beach. So these guys are swarmin’, but I’m holdin’ my own, okay?

“Right when I knock one poor sucker a foot into the sand, we see five of Scabbard’s Sky Daggers—that’s what he called these planes he had, real into branding, this guy—we see them take off into the air and we know they each got a payload that’ll blow a small town into a huge crater.”

“Who’s we?”

“What? Whadya mean who’s we?”

“You said ‘we see,’ so who’s we?”

“Oh. I thought I said that. Let’s see, we had Earl Grey, the Roman Candle, Supercomputer, Pizza Fighter—she was new like me, but she was pretty good—and her partner Kid Slice, Penumbra…wait, he’s a nighttime guy…Hm. Maybe it was Tommy Gunn? Damn. Hey! What does it matter who was there? It’s not the story!

“So…hell, where was I…I…Hell. Oh! Okay, yeah, so these plane things of Dirk Scabbard’s shoot off into the sky to blow up god knows what or who, okay? So I yell to the other, I yell, ‘Hey! You guys take care of these baboons for me. I got some planes to catch.’”

“Oh my god.”

“What, I was having fun! Come on. So I zip off into the sky after ’em. Now I was a little new to flyin’ and stuff, practically fresh from the isotope bath, okay? I wasn’t sure I could catch them in time, but I had to try. So there I am, givin’ it all I got when I don’t even know what I got yet. My flight path’s wobbly at first, but then I get the hang of it. I’m cuttin’ through the sky better than those damn Sky Daggers. So I start gainin’ on ’em and gainin’ on ’em, gettin’ real close, and that’s when they start unloadin’ on me! These bullets are high caliber and even though they don’t get through me, they still have a little sting to em’.

“I lose a little speed for a second, but my instincts kick in and I start flyin’ from left to right, you know? I still catch a few, but not as much, so I was able to focus. I could see where the cabin part was on ’em and so I fly a little further and further left and right, a little further each pass, and then I go for it: I veer way to the left and up and then, woosh! I veer down to the right, fast as anything you ever seen, and bam! I punch straight through all five of those things with my other arm hooked to catch the knuckleheads instead of ’em. Boom, the planes go in the drink, they’re sleepin’ with the fishes, and I got all five pilots passed out as I flew their sorry butts back to the beach.

“And that’s it.”

“Wait. That’s it? No one said your name or anything! That was supposed to be the whole point of this story!”

“Have you been eatin’ that coffee ice cream again? Huh? I swear you can’t sit still for anything. You know, patience is a virtue, okay?”

“I didn’t….uuuuuuugh. Whatever.”

“So that’s how I got the name Jet Puncher. It’s been me ever since.”

“Yeah, but who gave you that name?”

“Wha’?”

“Who gave you that name? Who called you Jet Puncher after you punched all those jets?”

“Who gave me — who cares? Whatsit matter who gave me the name? It’s *my* name.”

“Well, I thought that was the whole point of the story.”

“The point was…just listen to your old man for once, okay? Just listen to him when he’s talkin’ to ya, just for once, just sit down and listen to your father tell you a story. Is that so hard?”

“You got mustard on your face.”

“Yeah, sure I do. Come on. Mom wants you back by 7:30. I’m gonna see you this weekend, alright?”

“Yeah, I know. Was Kid Slice cool?”

“Huh? Who’s Kid Slice?”

“Dad! From the, the—”

“Oh, right right right. Kid Slice. Yeah, he was alright. None of ’em could play poker, though. Weird.”
