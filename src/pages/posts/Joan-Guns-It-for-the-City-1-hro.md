Joan guns it for the city. Flames hang onto the fringe of her white leather jacket for life and the ride. The presence.

The Ghoulies got choppers on either side, daring themselves to take the woman who just wrecked five of their best rat rods and Blooder Slim’s monster Caddy. The jacket makes her glow in the headlights like a ghost from hell or heaven, wherever wants them tortured the most.

“Scrap that fuckin’ bike or we ain’t got a place to go back to!”

Lizzie watches from her dad’s old ’83 pickup, pedal to the floor but dragging ass a quarter mile behind. Willing herself to be right up there beside Joan while she’s stuck in an old metal bag of bones giving it all its got.

A moment of focus, clarity, sets in and the panorama becomes fixed. Lizzie shifts down a gear and feels herself and the truck move unencumbered through space. When it’s only a matter of time, time is irrelevant. Her pale hazel eyes stay forward. One hand steadies the wheel while the other slips the .22 from the seat just through the hole in windshield.
