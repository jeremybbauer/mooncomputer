“Yesterday a guy complimented my shoes and then I set him on fire. I just...I don’t know, it made me feel weird. Who just goes around telling people things they…appreciate about them? You know? Now that’s, if you asked me what a psychopath was, that would be my definition.”

“Do you think it was a proportionate response?”

“Well...I think so? But maybe…Maybe I could have handled it differently.”

“Yeah. Okay. I want to go back to that moment when the man gave you a compliment. What did you feel in that moment?”

“Umm. Hm. Confusion? Uh, not anger, but, like...I know revenge isn’t a core emotion but I was really feeling like I needed revenge. Maybe some disgust. I _felt_ I needed revenge because of the disgusting thing he said. And I was confused why he would say a thing to me that would...prompt a...human arson.”

“Anything else?”

“Uh...Hm. Fear.”

“Yes, it sounds like you had a fear response to me. Can you remember any other times you received a compliment and had a strong reaction?”
