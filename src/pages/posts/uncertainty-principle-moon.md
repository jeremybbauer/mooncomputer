“The first successful teleport” means \
a subject started at point A,\
and after the device was activated, \
ceased to be at point A.

The intended point B was more\
of a hopeful point B. \
It was referred to, \
but not written down as, \
point X.

The first successful teleport’s point X\
was inside a Finnish brown bear.

Another success of the experiment \
was that they’d made \
the laws of physics choose \
a preference.

Two things cannot occupy the same\
space. \
One moves. 

Immediately. Violently. 

In this case, the subject, a man, \
was given preference. \
Men everywhere felt confirmed.

Physics decided the bear should move. \
Immediately. Violently. 

The good bear moved, fast as it could,\
in all directions. \
A sudden swell, a wet pop like\
a flat basketball tossed into a swimming pool. 

The man arrived whole. \
Maybe insane. Maybe that happened after. \
The data is inconclusive. 

While the bear was busy \
with its hasty, accommodating exit,\
the hardest stuff of it flew\
through its coat

except for some \
that couldn’t quite make it\
and bounced instead,\
returning. 

The man arrived standing but\
was forced to a crouch inside\
the macerated coat,\
bleeding himself

and bleeding the bear blood \
that also bounced.
