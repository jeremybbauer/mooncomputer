One by one, the rest of the park rose up and met the now frazzled onslaught. They all came. I thought they’d given up, but thank Christ I was wrong. 

I sat back in my seat and watched them all file past. I listened to the shots that were past my periphery and smiled. I didn’t realize how tired I was until this moment, when the adrenaline could finally stop its drip now that I was out of the fight. I felt like I could fall asleep right then and there, and it'd be the best I've ever had. 

I moved to take off my hat and felt a sharp pain in my side. When I looked down, at first I couldn’t tell what I was looking at. It was a blur indiscernible shapes and colors. The smell of blood hit me and I realizes it wasn’t sweat that wetted my side and back. 

A long tear of metal sheeting was connecting me to the back and front of the drive pod. Somehow I didn’t even realize I’d been suspended about an inch above my seat. I couldn’t leave if I wanted to, even on foot. Reaching for the loud speaker control, the borders of my eyesight fuzzed over. I strained all the muscles in my eyes that I could to try to keep them open. I couldn’t do that either.
