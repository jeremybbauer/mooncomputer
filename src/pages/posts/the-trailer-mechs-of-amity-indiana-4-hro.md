We’d done pretty good, but they just kept coming. We crunched a huge swathe of the fuckers, but there were more than we thought. 

A blast knocked my feet out from under me and damaged critical servos and maintenance systems. I thought they’d move in for the kill, but instead they swarmed on Dad. Despite all his strafing, laser beaming, and buckshot grenade chucking, they pinned him down. 

They focused their full force on him. I guess he was considered the biggest threat. That’s when I realized they were going to kill him.
