They didn’t see any lights in the sky or cattle suddenly confused as to where their skin goes. No strange metal fragments with odd properties regarding heat displacement or light refraction. What Luis Acevedo and Shondra Millhouse saw from the kitchen window of their Midwestern ranch-style home was a thin, brush-stroke smear leading to the back of their storage shed on a warm June morning in 1996.

Of equal fear and defense ability, they investigated together in slow, careful steps and with breaths as quiet as they could muster. They were both professors of Computer Science and used to taking concise, calculated steps, often together. Shondra held a new metal curtain rod she was intending to put up and Luis a wooden rolling pin still speckled with pastry flour, powdering his grip as they made their way to the shed door.

They stopped to listen, but heard nothing. They weren’t sure if that was better or worse. Shondra looked at Luis and pointed to herself and then the small rectangular window above the shed door. She kept her body flat and inched up higher and higher until as little of her as was needed reached the smallest corner of the window. She saw the push mower, a few cans of paint, the soldering bench, the various working and nonworking computers and computer parts. And then she noticed, just poking out from under the soldering bench, the tips of three thin gray things spread out like fingers.
