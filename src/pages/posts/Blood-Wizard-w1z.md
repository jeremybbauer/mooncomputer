*From the records of Tad Grabell*

I first realized I was a blood wizard when I skinned my knee doing donuts in the trailer court on a 10-speed. When you’re a kid, you’re more likely to think something amazing is happening than you’re going crazy. Especially when the best thing going for you is fantasy.

The bike flew horizontal and I followed, my head hitting the grass just past the edge of the concrete curb. My knee was drowned in the gutter gravel. It rubbed the dirty slab like a confused eraser, being torn up for no reason. I went to pluck the rocks out of the sting skin and the whole area was red as shit. Not just scraped up red, but dark ruby.

I started to feel like the weird part of grabbing an electric fence without the shitty part. A wasp flew around my head and I felt mad about it. After tracking its flight a few seconds, I felt light trickles from my knee and the wasp was skewered by three red needles.

I didn’t care that weird shit was happening. I wasn’t scared. I was glad to have something new to kill the boredom of the trailer court. I was glad to be offered something.

Now, the trick to being a blood wizard is to make sure it don’t get weird. Messing with blood in such a way can twist things. You don’t want a bunch of damn wounds all over you. To avoid getting gross-dark about it, you have to learn to watch for opportunity.
