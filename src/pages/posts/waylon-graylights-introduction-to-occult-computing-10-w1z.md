Learning to hide yourself, especially from your family, is sometimes a necessary skill. But it isn’t ever healthy. By this time, Alexei had hidden a great deal from his family and assumed he’d sealed it all away within himself like he was a brand new set of Tupperware, the lids of which were not even one bit warped yet. If he’d opened up to his family instead, maybe they could have gotten past the sudden delirium together. Tupperware never seals as well as you think it does. 

In the beginning, I mentioned that Alexei had things he had never dealt with. These things often resurfaced in his dreams. Sometimes with years or months in between, sometimes days or a few weeks in a row, Alexei dreamed that he was still a boy and his parents were still alive. Alexei would dream he was at work and had an important meeting soon. In the dream, he’d then leave his office and shift to being a child without a second thought while the walls made their slow transitions to those of his parents house or lake cabin. He’d hear his parents’ voices coming from some other room, walk to find them, always seem to reach the wrong room, try again while more and more anxiety climbed up his back and onto his head with each failure, and just when the voices sounded the loudest, the closest, he’d remember his meeting was supposed start any minute.

This might have been because when his parents did die, Alexei heard about it while he was at work. He had a meeting that day too, and was so stunned by the news that he stayed through the whole meeting. Once it was over, the deaths’ gravity finally activated and Alexei broke down in tears while everyone was leaving the room. He seemed to take on a fair amount of guilt for this reaction. It’s a possible explanation for the dreams, but it isn’t the full story.
