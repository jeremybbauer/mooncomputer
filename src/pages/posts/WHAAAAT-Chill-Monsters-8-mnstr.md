“Diega, I won’t experiment with your energies without your permission. I respect boundaries. But you could probably power the tv, the beer fridge, probably our whole house on your own.”

“I mean, if you could figure out how to make it so I don’t need to charge my phone, I’m down, but I’m not interested in just sitting around for hours juicing the place. If I’m sitting around for hours, I want it to be, like, I’m chilling.”

“Yeah, okay. Hey, is this guy walking toward us?”

“Ye--aw, hey, that’s Ear Medicine. Ear Medicine! Over here, man!” Gary waved his free hand to the lanky sliver of a young man sauntering towards them.

“Hey, man.”

“Hey, thanks for meeting up. This is Estelle, here, and this is Diega pushing this hover-thing with me.”

“Your name’s Ear Medicine?” said Estelle, trying hard not to look like she hated it.

“I mean, it’s Earl, but everyone calls me Ear Medicine.”

“Why?”

“Oh, uh, this one time when I was a kid I got this bad ear infection. And I had to put this medicine in my ear for it, and…that’s it, really.”

“Oh. Cool. Gary said you’re a wizard. So, what can you do? Like…what do you do?” Sometimes Estelle looked at Ear Medicine, sometimes she looked at her phone.

“Mostly, uh, capnomancy and chiromancy. Some other stuff, but mostly that stuff.”

“So…smoke magic and…what’s the other one? I don’t really get into that stuff.”

“Chiromancy? Uh, it’s hand magic.”

“Sounds perverted,” said Estelle, this time locking eyes with Ear Medicine with some intensity and a blank expression on her face. Ear Medicine seemed prone to blushing.

“What? No! No, heh, it’s nothing weird.”

“It’s okay if it’s weird.” Estelle’s intensity held.

“Uhhhh, okay…But chiromancy’s just like any other school. It’s a little niche, but I like it. It mainly just uses hands as the focus, but it has some special stuff too.”

“So…what do you do with your hands. Or whatever hands.” Estelle the Merciless.

“Uh…”

“Damn, Estelle, you’re gonna give the poor boy an aneurism. Hey, you wanna help float this static-bag?” Diega the Merciful.

“Yeah, sure. Is it…hard? Or heavy? Or…what is it?”

“Nah, the thing’s light as shit, I’m just tired of doing it. Plus, me touching it is what did this to it in the first place, so I’d rather not be so close to it.”

“Ah, ‘kay. Yeah, I can float it. Let’s see…”

Ear Medicine took a step back, arching an eyebrow each on Estelle and Diega. He focused his eyes on a point in the distance and took a deep breath. His hands passed over each other, seeming to almost melt together in the half light of waning night. As he did this, a third hand materialized, making the same motions. Then a fourth, then fifth, then a sixth and seventh before he reached out his forearms with his palms up and the hands moved away from Ear Medicine’s body to the back of the frozen ghost, pushing it gently forward.

“Okay. I can see that being useful,” said Estelle.

“Shit, I didn’t know you could do that,” said Gary.
