he emerged from his game-  
day basement, eyes fraught  
with gloomy wonder  
of the final championship.

outside the sun was blasting  
cancer beams and house music.  
this made bobby knight squint,  
frown with generation gap.

knight strolled down the cul-de-sac  
with his lab, buckeye, till, through  
his tracksuit, he felt the fangs  
of the sun sink into his back with heat.

“Fuckin’ Laser-Beamer!”

he turned and boxed the orb’s ears.  
the sun wailed with regret, cried  
plasma tears that ate right through  
buckeye’s leash. the chocolate

lab ran home while knight forced  
the kid dwarf to the pavement  
in a classic chokehold. concrete  
bubbled, mailboxes disintegrated,  
and lawns burst into flames

before knight released the sun,  
who sniffled, waved, and said,  
“real sorry, dude,” as he floated  
like a balloon to his dusty  
attic apartment, leaving knight

to sidle home  
through the smoldering  
horseshoe toward faded  
clouds of glory.
