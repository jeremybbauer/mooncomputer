Dear Diary,

Do you ever feel like you’re just waiting to maximize? Like on those old *Beast Wars* cartoons? Like that episode where the tiger guy’s space pod got cracked and he wasn’t sure if he was an Autobot or a Predacon or a snow tiger till Waspinator was threatening to kill the real snow tigers, and he was like “That’s a dick thing to do. I don’t feel like a dick so I must not be one of these dicks here dicking things up.” Then he maximizes and Neo’s all the tiger teasers. Lately I’ve been thinking that everything in a person’s life is just lead-up to when they maximize. I don’t know why I’ve been thinking that. I think it’s just loneliness. I don’t know. I just don’t feel…it’s like I’m hungry but sandwiches and microwave burritos don’t help. Dale says I need a girlfriend. Mom says the same thing. Roger said maybe I don’t like girls and I accidentally exhaled “hillbilly bigot” cause he’s always talking about hating gays and gets in weird hissies when Mom watches *Will & Grace* reruns. He said if I was gonna be like that I could leave. At the door I said to Mom, “This is why we can’t have nice things.” I’m not sure what that meant. Mom told me Roger has to go in for colonoscopy tomorrow, so hopefully they’ll find butt cancer and he’ll die. If the world was perfect, we could use one of those machines like in *Everything is Illuminated*. Or whatever that Total-Recall-Jim-Carey movie is. We could use that after he died and forget Roger ever existed. That would be the best. I don’t know why everyone talks about it like I’m not interested in having a girlfriend. That would be the tits. If I had a girlfriend I probably shouldn’t say “tits.” It’d be so great if I had a girlfriend and she loved me so much and then I would be a better person from being around someone like that, cause she’d also be real cool and teach about things probably. Sometimes I love the future.

P.S. If Roger died, maybe Mom could marry a Mothman. He could teach me mind powers and I could help him revenge Richard Gere. Fuckin’ up Indiana like moth gangstas. I bet Mothman wouldn’t have driven me to trying half an ecstasy and I wouldn’t have to be afraid of having drugs in my hair. Maybe I shouldn’t say “gangstas” anymore either.
