Billy started to show he had another way\
growing inside of him. Every follicle of hair \
stood forever, waiting. Lines formed\
in his skin and blushed more and more\
until they broke and a horse leg emerged\
from the neck up, its ugly zenith\
a hoof in need of cleanin’ ‘cause\
it was stuffed with too much mud and shit\
and one gray pigeon feather. I held him\
down and scraped at the filth with\
a steak knife and spoon, but it was infinite.\
I dug a hole as far as I could and buried \
the feather, hoping it reached close to the core.\
I couldn’t decide if it was best to cover back up\
with all the shit dirt or take it out completely\
so it’d be known that nothing so soft could exist\
in that head. Billy pawed at his tan leather jacket\
until it was shreds, took to wearing a duster\
and ball cap. He looked so flawed\
and alien that all anyone could tell him \
was how beautiful he was. He snorted through\
nostrils at his neck-ankle bone and wrote down\
nice things he wanted to say, but tried to\
destroy all their fine china and happiness\
when he got sad or hateful, which he did before, \
but now that his glitch had reached its full \
potential, they excused him and swept up \
the needled fragments every time.
