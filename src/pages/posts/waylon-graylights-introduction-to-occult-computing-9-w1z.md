Since Alexei’s family didn’t let on that they too were seeing the effects of the dream bleed, Alexei thought it was all illusory. He thought he was becoming mentally attuned to his dream computer instead of these oddities being manifested physically. The disruption was still in the mild stages, and I assume a little shame, fear, and denial kept Alexei convinced that things weren’t too bad yet.

One night Alexei walked past his son’s room and could hear him whispering. The gap beneath the bedroom door showed there were no lights on in the room, not even a pale flicker from the 13-inch television that would’ve been in the corner. It didn’t seem ordinary, but Alexei wasn’t one to pry. There were times, though, that Alexei was certain he could hear small ocean waves behind that door. Another time he thought he could almost hear hoofbeats, and another the sound a crystal glass makes when you rub your finger along its rim.
