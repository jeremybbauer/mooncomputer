Wisps of shadow fly from beneath parked cars and hedges, like leeches in a pond, towards a point in 20 feet in the distance. They swirl in a column and begin to undulate before amalgamating into a spindly seven foot form of murk and bone with two pale pinpricks of light. 

In a guttural low rasp, the shambling dim utters, “I…am what disturbs…a restful slumber…The chill that wakes…and stabs your gut…with dread and omen…I am…the butcher of dreams…and tonight I see…rich marrow before me…the Night Terror…”

“Uh. What the fuck?” says Estelle. “Hey! You think it’s okay to talk to people like that? Cloudy ass, creep ass…help me out, Diega.”

“You look dumb.”

“Yeah! You hear that, you dumb raspy motherfucker? And what did he call us? ‘Marrow’ or some shit? He’s bougie too.”

“I…will rip the dreams…from your skull…Insult…all you like--“

“Uh, I fucking *will* insult all I like. You come outta the darkness saying weird shit to two young girls, two young *women*, like you’re Freddy Kruger but without the scary finger shit. You know what that makes you? Just fucking burnt.”

“Wait. You wanna eat our dreams? What will that do? Why would I give a shit, I’ll just have more the next night.”

“Yeah, that shit’s immaterial. Who cares?”

“Dreams…are the essence of…life…”

“Um, okay. Are you trying to murder us or, like, inspire us? Cause you’ve got a confusing message, and it’s starting to feel like you’re practicing a high school graduation speech.”

“Pfffff, that was a good one, E. Ha! This guy’s about to start singing that Vitamin C song.”

“Huh-ha, yeah! Go on, man. You don’t gotta be embarrassed. We’ll sing it with you. One, two, one two three go! *As we go on, we’ll remember…*Pick it up D, he’s droppin’ it.”

“*All the times we…had togeh-eh-ther.*”

“That’s hot, D! That's hot. Let’s do the next part together.”

Both: “*And as our liiives change, come whateverrr, we will still bee…friends for-eh-eh-verr.*”

“Shit. That’s a good song. It’s getting me a bit.”

“It’s getting me too, E. Damn. Love you, girl.”

“Love *you*, girl. Hey. Where’d the dummy go?”
