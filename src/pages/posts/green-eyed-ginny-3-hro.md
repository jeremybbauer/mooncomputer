excerpt: I didn’t pay much mind to him after that. He seemed loopier than a
  roller coaster. Wasn’t his fault, but I wasn’t excited to listen to him the
  whole way to town either.

About half way down, the feller started to come to. 

“Whoa, what’s...who are you?”

“I’m Coop. That’s Bill what’s got your feet, there. We’re gonna get you outta here and into town.”

“Oh. Okay.”

He seemed pretty dazed, which was expected. 

“Why didn’t the woman take me? She’s so fast and...fast.”

“That was Ginny. She had somewhere to be, but she got us first to come and help ya.”

“Oh. Wow. That’s so nice! That was nice of her. Wow.”

“Yep. She’s one’a the good ones.”

“Yeah. Wow. I wanted to go through the trees though.” 

“Plenty of trees around us now. Feel free to gander,” said Bill.

“Just try to stay still, though,” I said. “Looks like you took a rough tumble and hit your head. Probably have a concussion.”

“Oh. Oh no. Okay. I wanted to go through the trees, though, like Ginny. She’s so fast!”

I didn’t pay much mind to him after that. He seemed loopier than a roller coaster. Wasn’t his fault, but I wasn’t excited to listen to him the whole way to town either. 

“After you rest up, you should get some different gear,” said Bill. “I could give you some pointers, if you want. Should prevent more of these noggin-knockin’ falls in the future.”

“Oh. Okay. That’s nice! I don’t want to fall. I think I need a helmet. And a sign. There should be a sign that says rocks will fall off the mountain and hit you in the head when you’re standing on it.”

“What? You didn’t fall?” asked Bill. 

“No, no way. I saw the woman...Oh, Ginny. I saw her going up the mountain and then I saw her see me and then I couldn’t see her no more and I was just standing there looking around for her and then my head hurt and I couldn’t see anything. I think the mountain...uh... I think the mountain hit it. It hit my head. Oh, then I did fall down. I’m sorry, I did fall down, um...uh...Phil? I did fall down, Phil. I’m sorry. I’m not a liar, I just forgot. I don’t even lie about anything, I just forgot, Phil. I would like a helmet. For when I’m standing on a mountain looking for a woman...for a Ginny. Then I won’t...um...then I won’t fall down, Phil.”
