“I have been reinforced by the will and the word of the almighty father.”

“No, you haven’t.”

“I…Well, how the hell would you know?”

“What were you doing when you were suddenly ‘reinforced’ or whatever?”

“That’s private.”

“Except everyone knows.”

“Well, God must’ve seen the goodness in my heart and fixed to…to lift me up.”

“What were you doing, Cliff?”

“Okay, so I was playing internet poker. It wasn’t a big pot or anything. It’s not even that bad. Ain’t no different than video games, really.”

“What else were you doing?”

“I think that was it…”

“Come on.”

“Fine. Shit! I was cooking drugs, okay? I was trying to figure it out, anyway. But I’ve stopped all that. I…oh, what’s that word? Repented! I repented all that. So, I’m good.”

“So, you were playing internet poker and cooking drugs, which is some impressive multitasking by the way, when something crashed through your ceiling, blew up your little operation, and blew your ass clear out the window. And you think that was God?”

“Maybe not Him directly. But yeah.”

“And because you found you can’t be hurt--“

“Yep. Forgot to look when I crossed 56th Street to get cigarettes and got bounced off’a Delmore Lee’s bumper.”

“--and can do that glowy thing with your hands since that day, you think that was God that blew you up?”

“Well, why not? Guy works in mysterious ways, don’t He?”

“Cliff, you once stole my sister’s car! And my cousin’s!”

“That last one I took back once I saw the baby in the backseat. I wasn’t ready to be a dad. Man, you’re really crappin’ on my Sunday dinner, here.”

“It’s Tuesday.”

“It’s an expression.”

“Cliff, you’re my friend. Somehow through the years, we’ve stayed friends despite you stealing from my family and friends, and even my preacher that one time--”

“That one was bad.”

“Now, I’ve stayed friends with you because I don’t think you mean any harm. I think that deep down you’re almost one of the good ones. But a champion of God or whatever? That’s…that’s a lot. That’d test my faith, man.”

“I get it. Me and mischief have never been strangers. But I wanna be good. One of the good guys. I don’t wanna hurt no one anymore. If there’s anyone what could see that ‘sides you, don’t you think it’d be God?”

“I don’t know, Cliff.”

“It sure as hell wouldn’t be your sister. Or your preacher.”

“Yeah. Neither’s fond of you.”

 “They’ve been clear on that.”

“You really wanna be one of the good guys? No stealin’ or dopin’ or nothin’?”

“Nuh uh. Not no more.”

“Dammit. This is weird, Cliff. You turning a new leaf’s freakier than you being a invulnerable glow bug.”

“It’s weird as shit. But it feels good. You gonna help me train?”

“Train?”

“Yeah, train. I ain’t run a mile since high school and my fight record’s shit.”

“What’re you planning to do with this training?”

“I’ve bought drugs from a lot of people in this town. Other stuff too. Heh, it’s kinda scary what you can get in this little podunk.”

“Yeah? Like what?”

“Ah, I won’t get into it. And you prolly shouldn’t ask me about it again. Legally speaking. But it seems to me this town could use some more divine intervention.”

“Or it needs more jobs, a competent government, and a better education system.”

“I don’t think that’s it.”
