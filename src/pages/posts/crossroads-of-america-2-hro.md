The horses on the TV swim across something black and flat. Something that swallowed their legs to glide them in ripples away from danger, but deeper into it too. At some point they’re supposed to have meaty stilt legs and curved rocks for feet again. A part of me thinks they never will. This is their lives now, gliding through a black expanse, adapted through immersion. 

“What’s this movie?” I ask. 

“Uh…I don’t know. A western. I don’t watch westerns.”

Di turns off the TV. It makes bloop sound, flashes white with reds, blues, and maybe some greens I barely catch, then turns black and sounds like a thousand electric fingers are breaking and recoiling inside of it. 

“So, what ya been up to?”

“Nothin’. Just workin’,” I say.

“Yeah? You’re not getting up to nothing more exciting?” She arches her eyebrow and makes one eye bigger than the other. I guess that’s her knowing eye or something. Normally I think her dramatic facial expressions are funny, but I’m off today. Everything feels like bullshit. Or dangerous. But not like dangerous bullshit, because that has a chance to be broken up by excitement at some point. Oppressive and mundane are good words for today.

“No. Not for a while. It’s not like how it was a year, or two years ago. Everyone left, I guess.”

“Yeah, Indiana’s had that problem for a while. Called ‘brain drain.’ I guess that applies to the evil or…you know, even the smart bad guys. Not just the people that go to college and then, _fwit_, outta here for New York or California or something.”

“Yeah. Lots going on in those places.”

“Why don’t you try out those places?”

“Me? Nah. I just…I don’t know. Mom and Dad’s stuff is here, you know? I don’t know if I can lose another job. And maybe some of that brain drain will come back. They got a brewery over in Brownsburg now. Supposed to be good.”

“They got breweries in New York and California too.” 

I can feel Di dialing in on me. I don’t know why it makes me so uncomfortable today. 

“Yeah, I don’t know. It’s okay here.”

“Aw, come on. You don’t like it here. Haven’t for years, now. Not since your parents left. And you can put their stuff in storage or something. Or I can check up on it from time to time. I don’t mind. Me, I’d be lost anywhere else. This is where all my family’s at, ‘cept for my uncle and a few cousins in North Carolina. I feel comfortable here. Right now, you look like about the most uncomfortable person I’ve ever seen.”

“I’m just having a weird day.”

“I’m not tryin’ to put you down or nothin’. I know things are hard. But you look like a person who’s stuck. Like a fly in one of those glue tape things they hang from the ceiling. You’re just kind of wriggling here. Just like, _bzzzz_…_bzzzz_…Just in place. But you not really in a glue trap, Ed. You can leave.”

“Oh. I--you want me to leave?”

“No, you’re fine. But actually I am takin’ off soon to trade cars with Shelby. But I  mean you can leave this town whenever you want. You got some good stuff in you. It’s only wasted if you’re not happy with what you’re doing or where you are, and you are not happy.”

This is too much at once. Too much to think about. I wish I had money to do something destructive. Or even knew what to do that’s destructive. I tried pot once, but it felt like my teeth were spinning in their sockets, or whatever teeth sit in. I’m too scared or drugs or even drinking. I’m too scared of a lot of things. People don’t realize you can do the things I’ve done and still be scared of so much all the time. 

“Ope, man, I do have to go, Ed.” 

Di scuffs her flip flops over to her off-white fridge. She opens the door and ducks behind it, tapping her fingers on the top. She pops her head above the door to squint at me a few seconds, then ducks back inside the fridge. 

“Take a cowboy soda for the road.”
