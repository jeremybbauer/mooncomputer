In his garage, Alexei scratched at the spoon some more until he removed layers of brass, gray, and brown spray paint and flecks of sand. He was left with a thin bar that looked more mineral than metal, sometimes appearing dark midnight blue with flashes of vermillion, and other times as a display of neon purple bleeding to coral, sea green, and ultramarine. 

Why am I wasting your time showing off my color dictionary? Who gives a shit what shade of blue or whatever the fuck some guy’s rock was? Well, I couldn’t tell you. 

But what Alexei stumbled upon was one of the rarest elements in this plane, as things from other planes often are. There have only been one or two other reported findings of this stuff in human history, so you’re not likely to ever see it, and neither is anyone in your family tree forward or backward in time, anyone you’ve ever worked with, anyone whom happened to be at the same party as you but you never met, and none of their future kids, grandkids, or parole officers. No photo references of the substance exist, it’s only described in brief mentions here, a tenebrous mystery there. It wouldn’t kill you to broaden your horizons anyway, so when asked what the snake looked like that bit you on some overpriced tour through Machu Picchu, you’re not stuck with, “green…but, like _way_ green. Like…Mountain Dew, but like the _label_. Not the mountain juice part.”

And how do I know what it looks like anyway, if it's so damn rare? That's a different story with an ending similar to Alexei's.
