This time it’s space. I am in a dusk parking lot and a man in a yellow tank top with brown curly hair is slamming dents into cars. He moves like gorilla blood. His eyes are lit with pale spots from the streetlights and frenzy. My body points my palms toward him, curls and connects my fingers, and I pull with muscles I see bulge, tense, and another that feels the same but is external and invisible. Red energy stretches and ripples behind the man in a vertical line, then stretches apart with my hands. I pantomime a swift jerk as if pulling a tether and a plastic crate soars into the man’s skull. He goes to sleep. His hair slowly gathers blood. Just as they always do.

I, the dream consciousness, exit my body to look at me. I’m 22–23, my hair shaggy and curly. I’m looking at my hands, then up where the stars should be. Instead there’s only streetlights and ambient light pollution. But then the stars start to shine through and I can see the deep blackness of space and its peppered gleams. I’m trying to tell myself, “Come on! You’ve got it now! You’ve finally got it!” I stare at my young body’s wide eyes and the moment is paused. It lingers. Then all is dark.

Hal Jordan is a broken man. Hooded with one cyborg eye. His hair is buzzed short, as if from a past relationship with novae or fireball or chemotherapy. He’s brooding and desperate. I enter his consciousness and feel his desperation as he grabs Luthor’s green metal collar. “Wait, where is that power! How do I find it? Show me!” Luthor smirks like an asshole, waves a Kevlar-gloved hand and time stops. I believe I exit Jordan’s consciousness and the invisible, roaming gaze of me magnifies a small waterfall. I see the power.

They look like toys, miniatures with similarities to the figures in the world of the dream. They are tiny variations on the figures. The power is possibility, the differences imparted by divergent paths. In the dream I realize that taking one of these tiny things for yourself is like taking an atom. Holding it. And then rupturing its skin of energy to release all that the possibility has.
