Hardware-based security technologies provide a critical foundation for secure occult tech. They address the numerous, increasing, and evolving security threats across physical, virtual, and extra-planar infrastructures.

As more acolytes connect to the eldritch networks and workloads move to the cloud, ritual-hacking is a greater threat than ever. Traditional schemes against heretic elements are not enough to keep the enterprise secured. Instead, the entire OT infrastructure must be secure, starting from the root with anointed platform silicon.

Trusted Infrastructure relies on hardware-based security built directly into the foundation of the platform. It’s just one part of the suite of advancements available in the Helios Circuit that makes it the most wholistic and secure occult stack on the market.
