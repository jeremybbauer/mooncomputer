Even for an accountant, Eleanor was boring. That’s not fair. Not all accountants are boring, just like not all froyo shop staff have an infernal covenant granting them inhuman energy and power for each cascading hoard of toppings they judge with caustic silence. Eleanor was boring because accounting was also the only thing she ever talked about. 

She wasn’t always this way. When we met in the ninth grade, Eleanor had other interests. Sneaking into the community pool at night, Hole (the band), cute boys with empty personalities, and horses in a big, almost frightening way. Just before twelfth grade, her family moved a few hours away. It was a dick move and rude affront to both of our senior years. 

We reunited in college, and have been best friends ever since. That’s why it’s so hard to be around her. If it was anyone else, I’d of ghosted by now or politely decline every invitation to hang out until they ceased or I went on another “social media cleanse.” Eleanor’s harder to leave, though the idea is starting to bloom flowers and sparkle more and more. 

Eleanor was tuning me into another episode of her thrilling adventures in corporate accounting when she said something odd.

“Wait. Back up. What was that last thing?” I asked.

“Uh…the part where I solved the production cost models discrepancy?”

“No.”

“Okay. The spreadsheets thing?”

“…Maybe.”

“Oh! Okay. Well, we have this computer on the ninth floor, and no one’s supposed to go to the ninth floor, but Jerry said he left his SEC reporting notes there. Later I found out that he left the notes on the third floor, but, anyway. I looked all around the ninth floor, saw some…weird stuff, and then I wanted to check Jerry’s email about the notes to make sure I was on the right floor, but I forgot my phone in my purse at my desk. I ran into this computer and thought I’d just use it to check my email. I *was* on the right floor, but, anyway. So, I check my email on this computer, and Linda finally sent the new quarterly assets acquisitions sheet, so I thought I’d check that. For some reason the file wouldn’t open. I thought Linda saved it wrong again, but no.” 

“Okay, you backed up way too far, but I think you’re almost there.”

“Cool. So, I looked at some of the recent files to see if they opened okay, and they did. But these files were different. They had personality traits, physical traits, and I thought it was just some customer research. But it wasn’t. I found an R&D document in the recent files too. It said that they were using this spreadsheet program for mapping the mental and physical characteristics of a human being. And this program was connected to another program that controlled a 3D printing prototype for printing in organic matter. 

“Pretty weird.”

“And, I tried it. I made someone. With a spreadsheet.”
