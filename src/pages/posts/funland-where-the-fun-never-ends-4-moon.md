We rushed to the door and saw the white flashes bouncing and disappearing into the twilight fade. 

“Thank shit, it was just some rabbits,” said Lacey.

“Jesus. I think my heart went into my throat and then I had a heart attack,” I said.

“That kind of killed my buzz. I’m gonna go home.”

I always hated this part. Lacey would go home, and I wouldn’t have any excuse not to go home too. Even though Lacey was still there for a few minutes, I felt alone. 

“Yeah. Killed my buzz too. See ya tomorrow, Lacey.”

I hung around a bit after she drove away, avoiding going to my car for a bit. I get stuck in this feeling sometimes where I have no idea what I’m doing or how to figure it out. It feels being at the bottom of a dirty lake where you can’t see past a couple of feet. After a few minutes I climb into my car, sit there for a few more minutes, and then drive home. 

I went back to the park by myself the next day. I wandered around not wanting to do anything but be alone. When I was near the arcade, I saw a blood trail leading in through the doors.
