“So, this is Doreen Mesman. She came to us because her perspiration is…liquid glass? Is that right? Hm. Well, it can’t be as bad as the guy that keeps throwing up bees.”

“He has a surprisingly positive attitude. He’s a good guy. I could see us even being friends, maybe. But I’m allergic to bees, so.”

“It says here that Ms. Mesman is depressed. Why?”

“What?”

“Why? Why is Ms. Mesman depressed?”

“I don’t think depression always works that way. You can’t always just explain it. Not everyone gets to just know this one thing that makes them depressed. For some people it can be…like, life, you know? Just the everything of it…all.”

“I thought you said you talked to her.”

“I did. I just…I don’t think we should be operating under such narrow views when it comes to mental health.”

“…Okay. What did Ms. Mesman say when you talked to her about her depression?”

“She said that the, uh, liquid glass stuff makes it hard to feel touch. She feels pressure, but most of the time can’t have any real tactile experience. It makes her lonely, isolated. She said she’s worried she’s a bad kisser now because, with the pressure thing, she thinks she’ll just be smooshing her face on someone’s face. You know, not kissing, just smooshing. I said, ‘well, a lot of people do that and they just don’t know better. Some of them are okay.’”

“I’m sure she was comforted by that.”

“Not really. She said, ‘Yeah, they’re called nerds, and I haven’t had to kiss a nerd since junior high.’ I said, ‘What do you mean had to?’ She said, ‘It’s junior high. They’re all nerds. Especially when it comes to kissing. But some learn better and then it’s the real stuff and not smooshing. I can’t believe I’m back to smooshing.’”

“It sounds like her intake appointment took a long time.”

“Yeah, well, some of that was the glass stuff too. She’s kind of slippery. I handed her a pen and she shot it right back at me. Like a cartoon banana or something.”

“Oh. I can see that being frustrating.”

“Yeah. She has to be really careful grabbing or holding anything. She can’t walk barefoot on any non-textured surfaces. She just goes right on her back and gets stuck in this whole hockey puck thing. It sounds terrible.”

“It does, it does. Steven…are you depressed?”

“I don’t know what I am. Maybe. Maybe that’s just life, you know? Maybe it’s just…like life’s default setting.”

“I don’t think so.”

“Well…okay.”

“Okay. I can finish the rest of Ms. Mesman’s intake, if you’d like.”

“Sure. Okay.”

“Are you going to eat that cruller that was by the fridge in the break room?”

“Yeah.”

“Oh. I ate that.”

“Well…Okay. Shit.”
