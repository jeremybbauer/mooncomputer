The night is made pocked by starlight and distant illuminated windows. He finds them on the roof and reconstitutes himself from a billowing gloom.

“I am darkness incarnate! I am a force of which you cannot fully comprehend--“

“Uh, I think not comprehending is more of a _you_ thing and less of an _us_ thing.”

“Yeah, Christ, have you ever talked to another person before? Speak clearly. And don’t tell me you can’t turn off that weird ominous echoey thing you’re doing if you’re so powerful.”

“No. Stop it. Don’t do this agai--”

“And what if we aren’t afraid of the dark? Or we have, like, a super good flashlight? I guess you wouldn’t have power over us then, right?”

“Enough! I will make you see. Feel the cold absence of existence!”

His dead white eyes relax. Wisps of something appear in the two’s periphery. They turn their heads in opposite directed trying to see what it is, but in the time it takes to turn their heads back, the world’s gone black. It’s so dark that it’s difficult to tell where the body is, if this is a trick, only the absence of light, or if the body still exists. If it is death.

Though they are enveloped only a short time, it’s hard to say how much time has passed when the light starts to seep back in and they find they’re back on the roof.

“Now do you have the jokes?”

“Oh, my GOD. That was sooo relaxing. Like a sensory deprivation chamber.”

“Yeah, what do you charge for that? You should definitely charge.”

“I have no need for coin or tender or any — “

“Really? Everyone could use a little walking around money. Like, if you want a snack or a Gatorade or something. Maybe some headphones…”

“I…No! I…some headphones would be nice. I’ve seen headphones. They seem nice. I don’t like Gatorade.”

“Awesome! You should totally, like, offer your services professionally. You could really help people.”

“Um…Do you…I don’t know what to look for in a headphones.”

“Well. I have a feeling wireless is kind of your speed, with that…shawl or whatever flying around and the rest of your lifestyle.”

“Oh, and noise-cancelling. We are in a city.”

“Yes, it gets loud. I do not like it.”

“See? That’s why your services would be sooo, so valuable.”

“I…okay. I will think about this. I feel…Goodbye.”

He makes a face like stone bowl being hit with a hammer. It seems sincere. His shoulders appear to soften and the tattered cape’s wild billowing seems to tame itself.

“I don’t like Gatorade. Um. Thank y--”

And, in a rush dusky air and shadow, he’s gone.

“That was, like, so good.”

“Right?”

“And _do. you. know_, that is like the third person we’ve convinced to get into the self-care service industry. We’re, like, really helping people.”

“I know! We really are. It’s a shame we had to kill that one guy last week, though.”

“Oh, yeah, he had, like, claws for a face or something? Blech. I didn’t really know his deal. But, some people just don’t want to be helped.”

“So true, so true. Hey, we should celebrate! For being good, bad bitches. Wanna get smoothies?”

“Yes! And, since we’re celebrating, I am going for a chocolate one, not the super kale-y one. I’ll just add some hemp protein or something.”

“Yes! Ugh, such a good idea. We totally deserve it.”
