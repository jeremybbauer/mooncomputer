As you move through time, it moves through you. As with space. And sometimes, things can get caught in you, like dragging an open hand through a millpond. Some kind of detritus. What passed through and got caught in Hereward Draper was another kind of detritus, that of an ever rot deep in the cold of the cosmos, the loose cloud of energies that formerly made up a hunger with too much mind behind it for the other old wills of the gray dawn. Dead or dormant, and an unfortunate reminder that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Only transferred.

Maybe it can be changed, but that’s yet to be seen.
