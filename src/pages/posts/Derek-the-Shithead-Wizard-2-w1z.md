I did a curse so Derek would get more dong emails than me. For I am Mandy, sparkle-death princess of no-fucks-given. Queen of the darkest shit with a kick like a snakebite shotgun mounted on a coked up unicorn with fucking flames for a face. Janice flaked like a chode. I shoulda known though. I threw barbecue sauce on her sliding glass door and wrote “chode” in it. I took my training to the woods past Randy’s trailer where it’s peaceful as shit. Where my moves can be free. People like Derek can’t call you a trailer mage if you become the best trailer mage there ever was. Anyway. My hair looks good as shit today so I can tell I have the power. Derek uses a ruby focus stone like a wuss, when everyone knows amethyst is better. Amethyst taps into the raw shit. I don’t need any dumb old shitty artifacts like Derek’s family has, like Crowley’s taint or whatever. God. Fuck Derek. He can go to hell, I’m doing this for me, for my own badass emerald leopard print life and soul, and when I’m shooting lightning from everywhere I won’t owe anyone nothin’. Okay. Time to get space zen and get these moves to the fucking limit.
