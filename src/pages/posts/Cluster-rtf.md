Lately my back’s been hurtin. Maybe it’s all this light I’ve felt in stinging trickles. I think it’s buildin up in there, formin somethin. I don’t know what, I’m gonna need an MRI since the damn aspirin ain’t workin.

_One month later…_

Screw me sideways! Well, I got the MRI and they found all that light, just a glowin cluster of, I don’t know, hell or heaven. When it came up on the monitor, this cluster looked like a thousand little men all hummin together, and the vibrations was what was makin my back hurt all the time. The doctor took it out and let me keep it as a souvenir, but one day the jar it was in was just missing, and, well, now I kinda wish I woulda left it be. What if it was my soul? What if it was Jesus?
