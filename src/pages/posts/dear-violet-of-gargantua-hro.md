Dear Violet of Gargantua,

I know it’s bad form, but I must start this with an apology: I see now that I adored you imperfectly, and I’m sorry. I loved you the best I knew how, but I was taught love by people even worse at it. You should have seen the previous models. 

You suggested I get help, that you’d even hold my hand through it, if allowed. I never took you up on it. I didn’t understand it. I was terrified of it in that deep place in my bones my mind can’t reach into enough to share with you. Accepting help can feel like dying sometimes. That’s the best way I know to explain it. Again, you should’ve seen the previous models. Really, it’s a problem with the whole brand.

You tower over me in so many ways. I’d fight with myself and then with you, and it would be hard to reconcile because the real issue hadn’t been given to the air. With your two great hands on my arms, you stilled the frantic, jagged ache in my body when I couldn’t. You did more for us than was fair. I’m sorry for that too.

You might be wondering the reason for this new clarity. Yesterday, an outpost near the Glassine Archipelago was destroyed, as were ten others in key supply route locations. The Circuit Breakers have been called up to help with the situation, and I will be leaving in twelve hours for Prote. From what you and I both know of Prote, there’s a chance I won’t return. 

I would like to write to you while I’m away. I understand, though, if you prefer I don’t. I’ll respect your wishes either way. If things get bad where you are, even if we aren’t writing one another, please reach out to my brother for help. He’s the one with the good heart and will help you any way he can. He also has training in navigating war zones, and will get you to safety if needed. 

If I don’t hear from you before I leave, be careful and take care of yourself. Thank you for all you’ve given me. 

Forever yours,
Chrysanthos of Phaloom
