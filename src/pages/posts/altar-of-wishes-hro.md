Their gambit was for naught. Jesse Gibson, the Nuclear Man, had never had his energies so depleted before. Angel Baby’s form had been disrupted, and the shifting between corporeality was taking a toll. They looked on, barely able to even speak, as the man walked between the corpses he’d made of the guards. Though there was no one left to fight, he still smoldered with rage as he approached the Altar of Wishes. 

“At your feet is the blood from thirty hearts. Including...the only person I’ve called ‘friend.’ I stand before you with this offering of life, and a singular purpose: I wish to be the most powerful being in the universe.”

A light hum began, almost imperceptible at first. As it shifted in pitch from low to high, the blue marble altar appeared to vibrate. The vibration created a light that spilled up the hands, then covering the body that stood before it, then those that laid beneath it. Jesse and Angel could only try to shield their eyes as the light filled everything around it.
