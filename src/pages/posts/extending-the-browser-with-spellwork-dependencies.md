In the CultDev space, the most exciting and also most difficult challenge always concerns making the tech work in conjunction with the physical world. You have a tech stack that you have to integrate with your hex stack—your rituals, artifacts, places of power, invocations, etc. If you can get both stacks and all their individual quirks, bugs, and limitations to compliment each other, then you can create some of the most flexible, powerful software to enter the market. 

A great entrance into CultDev is developing browser extensions with spellwork dependencies. Creating a browser extension that looks for thaumaturgical factors in the user’s environment, and offers different features depending on what factors are found, can still prove formidable to beginners, though. On top of a solid working knowledge of frontend languages, you need some experience with spellwork and debugging both.     The smallest thing can throw off the delicate balance between the two. 

For example, a few months ago, my company’s CultDev team had been stuck on a new feature for months. It looked like it should work, and we couldn’t figure out why we were getting nothing but errors and timeouts. Almost by accident, we discovered that we weren’t tracing our runes quite right. It didn't seem like a breaking issue, but my manager decided to contract a calligrapher to retrace everything. After he was done, the feature worked right away. And the calligrapher was brought on full-time to build out our new calligraphy team.
