Hello! Uh, I’m Jared Kopicki and I’m…uh, here at CultDev Conference to talk to you…um, I'm going to talk to you all…today, about…achieving…Ope. Let me just wake up the laptop again. Okay. Um…Right, so, I'm going to talk to you people today about, uh, achieving a performant microservices ecosystem in a modern cultdev framework. Just like it says up there…now.

Okay. So. Like…well, like a lot of people, I’m relatively new to the cultdev space. It’s been about two years, give or take. Um…before that, I was a full stack engineer at a fintech startup for two years or so, and before that I was a frontend engineer at a web app development agency for three years. It’s a fairly common, uh, career progression in this field, but…that’s me. 

So, now I’m working at a major U.S. banking corporation, can’t say who, heh, and I’m an engineer on their cultdev team. I got into this space after a buddy told me about his work in this space. I had no clue it even existed, no clue he was doing this…crazy and super weird work that I…now love, of course, but he spilled the beans, so to speak, and I started dabbling a bit, and, uh, here I am talking to…you fine folks. But I guess you already knew that part. Heh.

Okay, so, let’s get into it. Um, show of hands, who here has experience setting up microservices in a cultdev stack? Okay, so about…let’s see…about half of you. Great! That’s great. But, those of you that don’t have experience, that’s great too. As long as you have some engineering background, this should be for everyone.

So, those of you who’ve set up microservices in a cultdev stack, know that debugging is an integral part of it, right? I mean, debugging is part of any dev work, of course, but with cultdev, the vulnerabilities of your stack are…uh…*legion*, because the space is so new and poorly documented. Right? I mean, you may have API calls pinging servers arranged along the ley lines of the continental U.S., and that introduces this whole level of unpredictability. Right? Right. I mean, you’re connecting to communications markets that are just now getting their first integrations with tech in history. And to power sources that we don’t even have a reliable system of measurement for yet. It's…it's chaos! And that's why it's such an exciting space, and so rewarding and challenging. Right?

And, um, that’s just when your API calls are focused in the U.S., heh. So, when your APIs start calling systems within other planes, with different laws of physics, which can, and *will*, affect the way data’s transmitted, then…Well, then it can get reeeaaal interesting, heh. Right?

Okay. So.
