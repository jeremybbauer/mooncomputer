We got this dirty, brown cave somewhere on some island no one cares about, and in this cave is two computers. They’re plugged straight into the dirty cave wall and they each have a purpose: one for the ocean and space, seein’ as how they’re pretty much the same, and the other for everythin’ in between. The computers look the exact same and operate the same and smell like humans. They’re warm as eyes.

It’s prophesized that a sound like tricklin’ placental milk’ll seep into the cave causin’ a great blink like the original rumble. Circuits’ll fill with blood. Hummin’ screens’ll flicker, pinhole, and dilate. Supple meat’ll manifest and the hands’ll never stop touchin’ each other.

Like everyone, the computers won’t know what to do with genitalia. Like everyone, they’ll do what they can. And this’ll start what’s called the Binarium— dawn of the digital animal.
