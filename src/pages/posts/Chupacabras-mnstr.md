Chupacabras are much too beautiful.  
They exist in a dimension called Mexico  
and other things. They never suffer  
from indecisiveness or loneliness,   
and I have smelled many chupacabras  
and they are always formidable.  
A chupacabra will never pity you.

Currently, chupacabras dress in mists,  
red dust which keeps eyes dreaming,  
piss-scared, but people are far busier  
with the internet than they used to be.  
The world has gotten more bothersome   
to deal with, yet I can’t think to see  
my friends the chupacabras move to  
never, they have kept me   
fat, good, and wet.

The chupacabras know that I’ll be  
them someday, for my spine grows  
a quarter inch every year and my teeth  
a healthy three centimeters. When I dress  
I want to hold on to the mists as long   
as I can, because I want you to know  
I can kiss you like no one.
