Chupacabras are much too beautiful.\
They exist in a dimension called Mexico\
and other things. They never suffer\
from indecisiveness or loneliness, \
and I have smelled many chupacabras\
and they are always formidable.\
A chupacabra will never pity you.

Currently, chupacabras dress in mists,\
red dust which keeps eyes dreaming,\
piss-scared, but people are far busier\
with the internet than they used to be.\
The world has gotten more bothersome \
to deal with, yet I can’t think to see\
my friends the chupacabras move to\
never, they have kept me \
fat, good, and wet.

The chupacabras know that I’ll be\
them someday, for my spine grows\
a quarter inch every year and my teeth\
a healthy three centimeters. When I dress\
I want to hold on to the mists as long \
as I can, because I want you to know\
I can kiss you like no one.
