The element is called “oneirite.” After piecing together details from the scant previous encounter reports and consulting with a few privileged sources that will remain anonymous, oneirite is concentrated, crystalized dreamspace. This explains its incredible rarity.

It isn’t often that the very essence of a thought-plane somehow solidifies, through the plane’s own will or otherwise, and it’s less often that such planar formations are able to somehow move beyond their natal planes to others. If this was an easy or frequent occurrence, we would have been snuffed out eons ago. 

Planes themselves can’t coexist in the same space without being violently torn apart from the competing laws of those realities (it's happened before, which is why you never hear of humans thunder-sculpting or having an olfactory-future sense anymore). Matter, energy, gravity, psychic resonance—each plane has its own system for how these things work within it. This is also why things tend not to pass between planes, as a hunk of mineral deposits from, say, one of the chaos planes may turn into a flock of cormorants upon passing into ours. Or, it may simply blink out of existence when entering a different plane if the hunk's home reality system conflicts with the new plane to a great enough degree.
