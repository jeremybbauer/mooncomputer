“Today I’m here with Marilyn Manson, who has two New York Times best-sellers out right now: the latest addition to the wildly popular *Evermorn Chronicles* titled *The Children of Evermorn in the City of Neverlight*, and his part autobiography part self-help book, *We’re All Stars Now*. You are a busy man, Marilyn.”

“Well, I try to stay busy. I like being busy.”

“Two best selling books written almost at the same time, out at the same time, executive producer on the first film based on your Evermorn series, *The Children of Evermorn and the Black Skull of Hope*, and then you also have a TV show that just came to streaming. A, uh, a baking show, *Profiterole of an American Family*. How on earth do you balance all these different projects?”

“Well, I’m working with some really great people on each project I’m involved in. I couldn’t do it without them. And there’s my family, of course. My wife is my rock, you know, and her and the kids really keep me grounded when my schedule gets a little crazy. I also have a meditation regimen that I adhere to pretty strictly.”

But the acropolis stood there still, grinning with its skeletal jaw stark against the night. Gone were the months of planning, and likely, my brothers and sisters in arms. The mad god would not be toppled this night. I could feel time itself shudder at a future uncertain in the desolation it would face, in the amount of blood and cut-short fates it would take to get such an opportunity again.
