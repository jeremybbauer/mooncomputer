It’s easy to misunderstand magic and magical items. People often question the things only so far.

> “This ring grants me limitless power over life itself! My arm has been feeling weak lately, but I’m sure it’s unrelated. Probably…slept on it wrong or something. Can you open this peanut butter?”

Or:

> “I don this very cool tooth necklace and the minds of the animal kingdom are open to me…but I did find out my pet lizard is a racist. So…we’re trying to unpack that. And to figure out how to give away a racist lizard without it knowing.”

I’ve found a helpful analogy is to compare magic to electricity and magical items/beings to electronics. In a house with electricity, you have sockets, which you use to connect to this power. You plug electronics into the sockets to connect them to the power or to charge up the electronics’ own internal power reserve.

Magical things either have an active connection to power, have been charged up by power, or somehow contain their own self-restoring power source.

If your house experiences a power surge, this sudden, exponential increase in power can fry anything connected to it. And surges notwithstanding, any electronics, light bulbs, can only hold so much power. They can short out, catch fire, or explode. People — same.

As with peppermint schnapps and cocaine when you’re 15 at your first real basement party, you can’t know how much power you can handle. Not without jumping in deep first. There are strategies to insulate yourself, though. I may go into some of them in this book. I might not. This really more of a warning pamphlet than a guide book.

> *If it glows, stay on your toes.*

Don’t go picking something up because you think it’d be cool to pull a demon from one of the Hells into your office Christmas party. You might blow up trying. Or have a mental break, or worse yet, actually succeed. What the fuck are you going to do with a demon at an office Christmas party? If you get lucky, it will appear drooling and comatose from the planar shock, and still you just ruined a perfectly nice time in a not even fun way, and I’m sure Greg and Sharon were going to do great with that “You’re the One That I Want” karaoke duet, you know they practiced.

All magic — energy, items, beings, all of it — affects reality, the physics of the world. They may do so in different ways, be adept at certain effects, but it’s all some exertion over the makeup of things and the ability to resist such exertions.

#### Insulate yourself. Know your capacity. Stay safe out there, kids.
