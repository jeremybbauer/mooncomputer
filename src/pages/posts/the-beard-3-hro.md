  There was a man. Hereward knew him, but didn't. The man had changed since he'd
  known him, and had done so a great deal more in that time than Hereward. The
  man's eyes felt like a tractor beam and repulsor ray combined in an
  alternating pattern.

Hereward took to his feet with dazed caution and brushed the sand and yellow grass from his jeans. Quick movements felt unseemly against the beach. He adapted, as he always had, with a deftness that disturbed him if he thought too long on it. 

Waves rolled and folded in muted tones. The wind was more gentle than it seemed it should be. As Hereward squinted, looking for signs of life and unsure whether he preferred to find it, and saw a thin worn down trail leading away from the beach and over a hill that met the sky. He swallowed and realized his mouth and throat were dry. He didn't feel ready to meet anything just yet. But he knew daylight tended not to last forever and the night could be cold and vulnerable. He paused, absorbing the sun and wind and sounds he hadn't heard in what felt like a whole other side of time. 

Hereward started his relaxed yet focused stride up the hill, along the ribbon of faded ground, and tried to dredge the memories preceding this beached arrival. 

There was a man. Hereward knew him, but didn't. The man had changed since he'd known him, and had done so a great deal more in that time than Hereward. The man's eyes felt like a tractor beam and repulsor ray combined in an alternating pattern.

"Do I know you?" said Hereward.

"I think so. I'm not sure," said the man. His demeanor was still with a hint of trepidation. "Did you happen to come to the city with some friends?"

"Nope. Got here on my own."

"What about family?"

"None here. Maybe back home. Haven't been there in a while, though."

Hereward had been trying to bend a bicycle wheel that he'd found back into shape when the man arrived. He thought he might be able to sell it, though he was starting to doubt it, as he remembered there were always single wheels laying around, locked to bike racks and light poles and fences after the rest of the bikes were stolen. He decided the rest of this strained conversation was the burden of the man and returned to trying to bend the wheel again, not sure what else to do with himself as he waited for an end or something interesting. 

"Ah. It's a shame you've had to be separated from them for so long. Family's important."

"Not for everyone. Not everyone has a family. My friends are my family."

"Well, at least you have someone, then. Sorry, I'll get out of your hair."

The man turned to leave. Hereward felt irritated at the wasted time, the absence of resolution, and the damn wheel that wouldn't bend like he thought and wasn't worth his time either. As the man started to cross the street, he stopped. His head bent skyward as he took a deep breath and let his shoulders and back down where they belonged.

"Do you have a sister, named Hildie, and a father that makes clothes? Grew up near a stone tower with a thatched roof?"

Hereward stopped. His breath quickened and his muscles tightened. He wasn't sure he could speak if he wanted to, his throat full of stones. 

"Hereward? It's Dunstan. I made it too."
