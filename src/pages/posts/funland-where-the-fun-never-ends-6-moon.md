I could hear the same hum as before after the quiet. The more I listened, I could hear small fluctuations. I wondered if I couldn’t hear them before because of my buzz and then the blood, if they’d always been there in the sound, or if this was new. 

Once I paid attention, the depth kept growing. The differences in hum pitches started to sound like music. I’d notice another layer behind the current sound, then after a while begin to notice a layer behind that, and on and on, layer after layer. There were so many different pitches that it sounded like one of those big fancy bands that play in museums or king funerals or something. Whatever the damn word is. 

The layers kept doubling, and at one point, started to sound like quiet conversations. Muted somehow, like people talking through gags. I couldn’t understand them. I felt like I could read the tone of some of them—excited, angry, one sounded sincere like love—but I couldn’t tell if I was right. Even those grew sounding like a whole town, then city, then way bigger. 

I don’t know how long I listened. I do know that I started to hear patterns. It restarted. But this time I was hearing all of it from he beginning instead of piecing together the layers of hum as it went.
