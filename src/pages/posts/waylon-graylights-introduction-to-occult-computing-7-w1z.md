Alexei was able to solder the oneirite onto a PDS Ethernet card. He inserted the card into his computer, and at first, nothing happened. He ran all sorts of tests, but for days there was no change in how the computer operated or what it could do. A little of the shame over being duped that he felt before trickled back into his brain, and Alexei wrote off the experiment. If only he’d removed the card, though. 

One night, Alexei had a bout of insomnia. With his wife and kids asleep, nothing to do, and not wanting the TV to wake anyone up, Alexei got on his computer instead. And that’s when he found what was missing: the night.

Before then, he didn’t put it together that the shimmer he’d seen on the metal only occurred at night. From his computer’s PDS slot, a faint glow and tiny specks of changing light emanated. The computer’s operation still appeared to be unchanged, however, and he decided to look up something on an early search engine. Again, all seemed normal, but he noticed more and more search results that were just people’s names.
