Percy doesn’t look down. He shakes his head and with his eyes closed, tries to aim his face at where he thinks his brother is. 

“It’s okay. I can get that out,” said Percy. “Hey. I don’t feel good.”

Percy leans to his right for another wet heave. “I hate this.”

“I’m not a fan of it either. So, were you at a party or something? With, like, a ton of blue jello shots or something? I’ve been trying to find you all night.”

“No party. Just…went to Earl Craig’s. To use internet. Car…hit phone.”

“I understand you’re going through something right now, but I’m gonna need a sentence, Perc.”

“Oh, god. Okay. Uh…phone fell out my pocket. In front of a…PT Cruiser. When I was skating to EC’s. Jesus. I feel weird.” 

Percy’s face looked pained, covered in beads of sweat. His expression looked like he was trying to pull his brain out of a swamp and kept losing his grip. His eyes opened in just thin slits at a time, about the size of a fingernail clipping.

“Did you smoke at Earl Craig’s? I told ya, man, you gotta watch that. Seems harmless, but sometimes they lace shit. You know the golden rule: If you didn’t make it, you don’t know what’s in it.” 

“Not the golden rule.”

“It _a_ golden rule.”

“Well…I…no. Just, shut up for a second. No. No smoke. Was working on the…the business plan.”

“Okay. Then, what happened, Perc?”

“Did…did Estelle see me puke?”

“Uh…No, you’re good.”

“Yeah, I did,” shouted Estelle. “It was real weird. But kind of cool. In a weird way. I think you sat in it, though.”

“I didn’t. Thanks. All…all good,” said Percy, trying to wrench his face muscles into a smug smile.

With fading confidence that his brother’s blue cascades into the lawn were over, Gary reached down and swept Percy up onto his feet with one arm around Gary’s shoulder in one smooth, elegant motion. 

“Can he come inside for a bit?” Gary asked. 

“Yeah. But if he pukes on it, he buys it,” said Diega.

“…You don’t sell anything?”

“That’s right, I don’t. Because I like my things and I want to keep my things. But if your brother’s gonna puke blue, glowy, space swamp water all over my things that I like, I am going to need those things replaced.”

“Fair. Thanks, Diega. I’ll put him in the bathroom by the kitchen at the first sign of trouble. Toilet, trash can, he should be good.”

They all move towards the entrance of the house in silence. After the door’s unlocked, the lights inside are turned on, and everyone sighs to themselves from the long awaited indoors providing a temporary feeling of safety, Estelle twists her hair into a high pony with a few golden hair ties left on the coffee table.

“Okay. Now what?”
