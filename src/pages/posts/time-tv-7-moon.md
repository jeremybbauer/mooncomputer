“The thing about the fortune teller telling people they would die soon and then killing them, that one checked out. She would give the victims what she said was a good luck charm free of charge, and these charms had little Bluetooth trackers in them. So, she’d go to the victims’ houses and turn up the gas, or poison a bunch of stuff in the fridge. When the people died, while their families were figuring out all the funeral and estate stuff, she’d go and rob the houses. The families had so much going on that they never noticed anything missing.”

“Huh. Okay. And what about the other thing?”

“The other thing: ‘She is either a werecat, a mannequin come to life, a necromancer, a living skeleton, or an alien but not the good kind. One of those. But maybe two things.’ That one did not check out. She actually twisted her ankle in her driveway a couple of hours before we arrived to arrest her, so medical checked her out. She’s just a regular person…who killed people and stole their shit.”

“Hm. I had a good feeling about that one. She sure was something though, eh?”

“I mean...she was a murderer.”

“Right? Heh.”

As the crystalline layers sloughed off her body onto the floor, Ingrid took her first breath in 33 days. The sun was setting, but still her eyes took time to adjust to the tired light. The little broken crystals grabbed what light they could and bent it around Ingrid’s feet in a kaleidoscope bath. 

Ingrid tried to remember the last thing she did or thought, but her memory’s return was slow too. It felt like the morning after a blackout, but without the vibrating stomach or ringing skull feeling. She looked down at her feet, and the colored light, and the little crystals, but had to look away. Piecing reality together was difficult, and fitting in the little crystals only made it fall apart again.

“I’ve been piloting this thing for six years now. This hunk of metal hasn’t given up on me yet, and I’m not going to just abandon it to that thing. All of you can leave if you want. I’m staying.”

There was silence. Captain Zero wished he had been better. Kinder, maybe, capable of some warmth. He wished he could break tension with a joke like Sergeant Seven, or express the deep gratitude he felt for his crew the way Private Five could. Zero felt pressed against a wall of himself as he watched and waited for the other pilots’ response.
