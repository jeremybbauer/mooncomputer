Dad’s mech can’t take much more. The titanium-laced siding is degrading. The robin’s egg blue is turning midnight. The sensors and gauges must be screaming in there. And mine…

I’m going to have to watch him die.

When he told me they must have been drawn here by his Invisible Indubitable Shield, that it was the perfect, undetectable infiltration point, I didn’t hesitate. I chugged my Yoohoo and activated my SWELL (Single-Wide Enabled Light Locomotion) mech. We’ve done everything ourselves with no help from anyone and we’ve always been just fine. I didn’t expect the whole of Rosewater Court Mobile Home Park to join up with us, but I didn’t expect all of our neighbors to turn away from us either. I was sure we could win anyway. We weren’t shaken by the first wave.

Dad found the machine they used to make ghosts. They combined a psychic impressions extractor with a hard light projector, and the town was overrun. The ghosts weren’t dangerous. They mowed lawns, kept trying to fix plumbing that wasn’t broken, balanced their invisible checkbooks, worked on cars they thought were right in front of or on top of them — the stuff of their lives. What they were was a distraction.

The first wave tugged at the minds and hearts of the Court. The second wave was more…mean.
