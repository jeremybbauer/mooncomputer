“Got anything more...fun, I guess, to do?” 

“Fun? What you’re doing now isn’t fun?”

“Not really. I’m not really into torture. Or seeing people torture themselves.”

“But they’re learning. That’s what’s really happening.”

“I don’t know that they are.”

“Remember another time you asked for something fun and I gave you that budding musician to, uh, guide? What was its name...”

“I thought you were omniscient or something. That’s supposed to be one of your omni things, right?”

“Yes. And I’ve also been around since there was anything to remember. So, I know the little thing’s name, I just can’t remember it right now. The word fits.”

“Okay, I guess, but the musician thing wasn’t on me. I do not take responsibility for that going so weird.”

“You were supposed to guide it. It wasn’t a very good musician, they never are at first. You could have helped it, I don’t know, create a new genre or just create music that was uplifting and helped others. That was bitchin’.”

“I don’t think people say that anymore.”

“Oh? Oh. Hard to keep up. They change things so often.”

“Anyway, whatever happened with that guy, that wasn’t me. Okay? I mean...why did you even give them the capacity for that sort of thing?”

“Within themselves, each of them has the potential to be a force of great benevolence or great horror. That is the foundation of free will.”

“Is it, though? I think they could just be nice and still do what they want.”

“No. Well, maybe. I don’t know. I wrote that directive a long time ago. Before I had to take away all the cool stuff because wouldn’t stop teleporting each other into suns or breaking planets apart. Anything more than okay intelligence, and pfft. It’s a shitshow. Do people still say shitshow?”

“Yeah.”

“That’s a good one. They do come up with some good stuff. So, religions, corporations, and musicians you’re done with. Hm. How about...oh! How about NASCAR.”

“With the...the wheel things, the uh...Cars! With the cars?”

“That’s the one. Maybe we should do another little wager.”
