On the floor since time imperceptible, surrounded by the empty carcasses of a month's worth of gas-station-run junk and dog hair from a friend long past, it occurred to me that the power I had wasn't the scary part. The thought of changing ate at my veins, though I knew I'd already changed. I hadn't accepted it yet. Even when life is a wet garbage leak you don't notice until you're covered in stink, you get used to it. You end up crawling into the garbage bag, get used to the smell, find a spot that's just moist instead of wet, and decide this makes you strong. You chose the garbage, it didn't choose you. This problem is so common and simple it's irritating. 

At night to go to sleep, I picture the old trailer on the hill. A small orange light peeks from the back of it, the pasture behind starts to glow with soft light. The orange light grows and splits like cells, over and over. They line the whole back of the trailer like red, orange, and yellow peacock feathers fanning and waving in the dark. I can see their breath. It reminds me that it's cold outside. That I'm cold, but there's heat in the distance. I can hear the hoofbeats of the horses in the pasture, excited by the glow and running just to run.

I like to think that no one really knows for sure if they're a killer or not. Everyone's walked away from something. Everyone has felt their blood invert from standing in the throat of danger, the wave of heat cresting the back of their neck and scalp before something absolute falls on the world.
