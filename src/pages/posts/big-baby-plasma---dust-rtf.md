indiana and the universe   
could no longer contain bobby knight,  
who was replacing bodies with black  
voids and infants with star clusters

by the time he’d made it to the baseball   
diamond, he was already exploding,  
announcing to those gathered he was

their burning bright salvation,   
vowing to love them to the final   
championship, and we vowed back,   
we’re with you till darkness

tiny flickers of light grew mouths  
like pit bulls, scarring the animals   
and eating our hair to the scalp,  
curing our lice in a mean way  
as knight became the sun
