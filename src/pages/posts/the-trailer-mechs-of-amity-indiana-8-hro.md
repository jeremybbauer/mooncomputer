I wasn’t sure where I was waking up. It was bright and hard to see at first. After covering my eyes for a few seconds, I could tell I was looking at a window where the sun aligned just right to burn my eyes out. The window had thin, pale pink curtains on the sides that looked weathered but cherished. I saw the wood paneling on the wall, and knew I was in the room dad had made up in his trailer for remembering Mom. 

“Chief! You’re up! Welcome back to the world.” The room never had a bed, so Dad must’ve brought his in for me. He shot up from a chair to the left of the bed, beaming like hell. 

“Sure. Hey,” I said. 

“Don’t feel like you gotta get up or do nothin’. You could probably use some more rest. The stitches could, anyway.”

I tried to lift my head up to look, but got a sharp pain where the metal had been. It could wait, I guess.

“We got ‘em, right, Dad?”

“You bet your ass we did. Not a one’s left of them.”

“Well. You did it. We’d be charcoal if you hadn’t got the park to save itself.”

“It wasn’t me, bud. They didn’t do it for me. They did it for you. They saw you knock me out of the way and put your life on the line to save mine and theirs. You inspir’d ‘em. You got the park to save itself. You’re, like, their hero, man.”

“…What?”

Then I just started crying. I wanted think I was just happy that my dad and everyone in the park was okay, but that wasn’t quite it. I guess I never thought I was too great, and far away from someone anyone might find inspiring. I’ve felt low-rung and insignificant all my life, or at least since we lost Momma. I never put words to it like that, but there it is. Sometimes you don’t know you feel a certain way about yourself until you’re told that’s not what the rest of the world thinks of you.  

“I’m here. I got ya, son.” Dad put his hand on my shoulder. He tried to wipe his eyes with his other hand, and flung his glasses off his face and into a small trashcan by the bed. When he pulled them out, they were covered in some kind of yellow goo and had a bloody bandage stuck to one of the lenses.

“Shit. Was that goo from me?” I asked.

“No, it was from me. Made your momma’s lemon cheesecake recipe.”

“Aw, dang. You were just sitting by me eating cheesecake while I was passed out? Why’s it in the trash?”

“I forgot the sugar. It’s awful.”

“Dang. What if we just put sugar on top or somethin’?”

“Tried it. Still real bad. I think the eggs were too far south too. It tastes like someone dumped cleaner on some garbage.”

I laughed, then he laughed, then I tried to stop because I felt like I was ripping something, and Dad tried to stop laughing to help me stop laughing. 

“They really call me a hero?”

“Sure did. And when you’re up to it, they can’t wait to see ya.”
