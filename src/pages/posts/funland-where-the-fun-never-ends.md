The amusement park was way more fun after it closed down. You could skateboard through the funhouse (or try, at least), break into the storage room and steal leftover cotton candy, posters, and mood rings. And best of all: you could smash the ever-loving shit out of anything you wanted. 

Sometimes Lacey would get beer or weed from her brother.  We’d climb up a roller coaster and get buzzed watching the sunset. Once we split a pizza up there. It was a rickety, rotting paradise. It’s the only time I’ve ever felt content.

After a month or so wrecking around the park, we found the arcade. We couldn’t believe we missed it. We used meet up there after our concessions shifts almost every day back before the park closed. Somehow we must’ve kept walking past it.
