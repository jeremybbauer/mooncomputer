All the computers at the library are down, for some reason. All except one. The keys feel like some Cheeto-muncher-finger-licker was all over this. I can feel the crud layers attempting to transfer. Sometimes everything is bullshit.

The beige everything, the sad ferns, and the smell of old, stale books and people makes my body quiver. My pupils expand and contract and I feel the orb behind my eyes again. It spins. It spins on the gun rack before and in my skull now at the same time. It fills up my eyes with its sound that’s sometimes barely anything and other times is like a cave of TVs blasting static at full volume.

It was less than a minute this time. I snap back and start the slow churn of Netscape. Saying “Jesus Christ!” too many times, no matter how muttered, always gets the crinkly book jockeys staring. For a second they all seem stuck, but I don’t have it in me to care.

“‘Ey, man, you heard about this why’to-K? ‘Sposed to be real bad. Heard on the radio that it’s gonna make gas go up and nukes’ll get confused and blow up Lake Eerie. They got government bases under Lake Eerie.”

“I mean, who really gives a shit, Daryl? I think we’re always supposed to die.”

“No, not me. I drink two jugs of milk a week. My bones are like rocks, man. Like really…hard rocks, man.”

“No, I don’t mean like we’re all gonna die someday. I mean that there’s always, like, ‘Aw, this year Nostradamus said Texas would turn into fire’ or ‘The Aztecs said meteors are gonna hit each McDonald’s Easter Sunday ’98, eradicating our main food supply.’ People have been saying the world’s ending since they had the idea.”

“Okaaaaayyy, man. But we never had computers before. Or the in’ernet. Kinda makes you think.”

“No, it doesn’t.”

“Okaaayyy.”

Daryl always clicks his tongue in the side of his mouth when he thinks he’s right but is trying to drop it, whatever we’re talking about. I usually hate it. Today it started a rhythm I couldn’t get out of my head. Almost a beat. *Click rest rest rest Click rest rest rest Click*… It’s almost nice at first. Then it gets louder in my mind and makes my skin feel like it’s rippling after every click. It’s a weird day.

“Aw, sweet, Carla commented on my post. Hey, Daryl. Carla’s gonna be at Deshawn’s basement tonight and said I could come if I bring Jaeger or vodka. You wanna come too, man? We can get chili fries and tacos on the way. I owe you.”

“Yeah, sounds good, man. I was gonna hang out with my mom, but she was busy with Jeff anyway. You don’t gotta get me nothin’.”

“Daryl, I owe you. And if the world ends tonight I can’t have any debts on my conscience. Plus you saved my New Year’s, so let’s get you some grub.”

“Aw, thanks, bud.”

The orb gets in my head again on the walk to the car. I don’t think it usually sticks with me like this. I’m getting flashes of the library computer screen too, right in front of my face. Like everything’s sticking to me. Like I’m one of those sticky hands you get for a quarter at those little machines in Shop Rite, and you slap it on everything and everything leaves something on it. Till it doesn’t work anymore. Is this Y2K?

Why can’t shit be less bullshit? And complicated? It’s New Year’s Eve. A night of possibility. So far in my life, New Year’s Eve has been nothing, but every year, it could be something. It could be it. Shit getting different.

After chili fries.
