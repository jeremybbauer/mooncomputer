After Dad and Mom were gone, I thought I needed to get serious about something. I always looked up to the smart ones in the game. The ones that figured things out, pieced together all the complex strands of a thing instead of waiting for the loud stuff to happen. So, I looked for something to try out this new way. 

Up north there was a missing person that showed back up after being gone for something like 15 years. He was four years old when he went missing. His parents were divorced and everyone thought it was the father that took him, until the guy was found with a suicide note in a car no one ought to use anymore. When the boy popped up again, now 19, his face was halfway in the sand with pink corydalis around him and gunshot wounds in the shoulder and chest.
