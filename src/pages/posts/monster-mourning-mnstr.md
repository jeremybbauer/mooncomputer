Someone I don’t know lost someone. 

I almost reach out. I want to console them. Say I know how they feel. 

But I don’t know. I don’t know them.

I don’t know the person who passed. 

I want to be there for this person I don’t know in this hard time having lost another person I don’t know.

What am I grieving.

Everything. 

Probably some specific things. But it feels like everything. I’m grieving everything.

Like the woman they say drowns babies, though she doesn’t want to, because when she was alive she drowned her own babies. Though she didn’t want to.

Since 1999, I’ve been waiting to learn that I was dead this whole time. Is it a twist if it makes sense?

I guess a surprise birthday party is a twist that makes sense. I don’t believe in coincidences. 

I think I’ll leave the person alone, to their friends and family and those grieving a more similar grief. I’ve played enough video games to know that a wound monster is a bad guy. They appear, running at you with some inky, grabby darkness flowing out of a stab wound, or guts turned tentacles going pink murder spaghetti, hugging too hard, pulling you into a warm, airless chest cavity. 

Or…I don’t know if that was in a video game. I don’t know where I saw it. 

Maybe it’s just how I feel.
