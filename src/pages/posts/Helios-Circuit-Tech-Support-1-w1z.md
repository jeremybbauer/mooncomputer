Hello! You’ve reached Helios Circuit support at GEM R&D. My name is Dave. How may I help you today?

O-kay. Right, okay. Yeah. Hmmm…Okay. So! You’re switching to Helios for your data storage and management because you had cloud storage but their security only covers one plane of existence…But during some of the data migration, one of your cult…uh, sorry, one of your “team” members disappeared in a silvery mist and the other was absorbed into the Helios Circuit. Do I have that right? Okay. Huh. Yeah, that’s definitely not the intended behavior.

Let’s see…can you tell me if you happen to have any sigils present and active? You do! You have one there and it seems to be active. Okay. Can you tell me the name of that sigil? If you happen to know it? “Marbas.” Okay. Let me look that up in our system. Just a second.

Ah, okay. So, I see here that the Marbas sigil isn’t one of our officially supported sigils. No, I mean if it’s not officially supported it doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t work, but it means that it’s difficult to predict its behavior, you know? It just means we can guarantee that it will work all the time or as expected. So I totally understand that the Marbas sigil worked fine up until now. That’s how it goes sometimes. But since it isn’t officially supported, it may be difficult to fix this issue…uh…cleanly. But I might have a few things we could try. I don’t want there to be any data loss or anything. Or, yeah, or any loss of your team members, there. No, definitely, yeah. We don’t want that.

Can you tell me what the sigil looks like? Okay. Started as chalk and animal blood. Yeah, sure. Okay. Got it, yellow and glowing, kind of hovering above the floor. Yeah, good. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about the design of it? Okay.

Oh, uh, real quick, did you already try banishing and then re-summoning your sigil? You did. Great! Oh, that’s when the second person was absorbed by the Helios Circuit? Oh, gotcha. Okay. Sorry. You know, we just always have to ask. Sometimes that does the trick. But gosh, I’m sorry to hear it didn’t help in this case. I’m sure he’s…uh…

But, okay, sorry about that. So, can you tell me about the design of the sigil? Great. So, it’s a little complex…Okay…. So…Okay, I just want to confirm that I understood you correctly. It looks like a guy…a guy’s face, sorry. It looks like a guy’s face with a…uh knight’s cross for a nose. Okay… And this guy, the sigil, has a cross as a dangly thing…Okay. Where his…Where his what would be? Oh, ha, okay got it. Okay, anything else? Looks like a trumpet’s going through him and he’s wearing…a bandana? And there’s a bee in there? Oh, not the bug, the letter. Okay, got it.

Hm. Okay. Well, I’m looking up Marbas and…I’m not seeing that that really matches that sigil’s description. Hm. Let me see here…Let me, uh, I’m just going to check one more thing. And thank you for your patience with this, we really appreciate it.

Oh, thank you. That’s very kind of you to say! Yeah, we’ve got a good support team here. We just, you know, we’re a team of people that likes to help people, so…Ah, thank you.

Okay, let’s see…Oh! Oh, okay, I think I see what’s going on. I think you actually have the sigil of Bathin there. Yeah, I’ve looked through our system and I happened to remember the, uh, the dangle you mentioned from helping another person. Oh, you know Bathin! Ah, great. Okay.

So, as you may know, Bathin can take one wherever they want to go, helps with astral projection, and can suddenly take people from one country, location, whatever to another. So, I’ve actually seen this exact behavior before. Sorry about that! It took a bit to jog my memory, but your great, uh, sigil description finally did it. What’s that? Oh, ha, yeah. It *was* the dangle.

So, your team member that disappeared in the silvery mist, I’m pretty sure they were just transported elsewhere and at the same time started astrally projecting, possibly unbeknownst to them if they haven’t done that sort of thing before. And the other team member that was absorbed into the Helios Circuit, I believe the sigil just used the Helios as a conduit for its transportation effect. So they might just be…elsewhere right now. Yeah. They’re likely just fine, yeah.

One of them just texted you? Oh, that’s fantastic! Awesome, yeah, that’s great! It was the one that looked like he was absorbed…oh, and he’s just a few towns over? That’s wonderful news. That’s great, yeah. Okay!

So, you should be able to banish that sigil without issue. You might wanna try, like Purson or something like that as a replacement. One of the sigils about finding lost things, yeah. One of those should help you get your team members back quickly. And it should help you identify any data leakages that could occur with the data migration. You’ll probably want to discuss this with your CSM to find the right sigil for your needs and configurations, though. That’s what I’d recommend.

Oh, and speaking of configurations, you’ll want to unplug and plug back in your crystals hub before spinning up another sigil. Yeah, it’s just best practice, you know. Give them a good recharge in the sun or with silicate or something too, yeah. That’s a good idea. Couldn’t hurt!

Great. I’m so happy I was able to help you today! Aw, well, thank you. You…you’re too kind. Thank you.

Okay, and…I’m so sorry, what was your name again? Crystal? Crystal Tenebris. Okay, thank you. Hmmmm. I’m not seeing an account for you within your organization’s account…Oh! Oh, it’s under Susan, you say? Okay. “Susan Lemquist.” Okay, got it.

Ah, found it! Great. Thank you, Susan. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today, or did you have any other questions? Okay! Well, you have a wonderful day, Susan. Yeah. Oh, it was nice talking to you too. Okay. Mmmm-bye.
