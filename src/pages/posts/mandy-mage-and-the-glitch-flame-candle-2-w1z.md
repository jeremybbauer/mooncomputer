I wanna just set the guy's fridge on fire, but I’m trying to play things more brainy. On the last job, some dick with a panther shirt knocked my keychain Trolly Stardust into a dog pit. The nerd still can’t feel his face, but I don’t want to lose any more of my good shit. Rest in peace, TS. A lady with the best van art I’ve ever seen—tasteful but wet hot—and a shopping cart full of oranges traded me a Pane of Looky Lou and told me the direction of the local chapter of The Honorable Society of Rubberneckers. I wasn’t prepared for them to be human taffy-pulls. It made me think of what people said chicken nuggets were made of, like the ice cream at a good buffet but made of pink cream meat. Can’t beat a nonprofit that offers surveillance services for donations to food shelters. Financially this is all fucked still, but I needed this stuff anyway for the personal project. Lost-face panther man made it seem like the hairdresser what hired me for this new job knows something about the artifact, or whatever the thing’s supposed to be. I will take destiny by the beautiful face and say, “I ACCEPT YOU, DO YOU ACCEPT ME,” and I think that shows real growth because I don’t even plan on throwing in any fucks.
