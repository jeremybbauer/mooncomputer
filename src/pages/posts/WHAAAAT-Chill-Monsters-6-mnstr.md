A silence held in the air for five seconds while Diega, Estelle, and Gary glanced at each other, the walls of the observatory, the ghost dipping and rising in its hypnotic hover, and the floor covered with the sea of cassettes, subtropic flora, and the 1990s nostalgia dream.

“That song sucks,” said Estelle.

“I kind of liked it. But, like, in a way where I don’t need to hear it again,” added Gary. “This always how you talk to your Zaza, D? That’s worse than getting texts from my grandpa. That…whatever that just played was a little clearer than my grandpa’s texts, but I’d have to limit that communication, ‘it was me. No offense.”

“No. That isn’t always how we talk. Zaza’s only talked to me like that maybe…two times. It means they can’t talk to me directly. Which isn’t good.”

“Shit. Hey, Mr. Ghost, sir, do you know where my brother’s at? Percy? Either talks too much or not enough…looks like a slightly shorter, skinnier, not as together version of me? Skinny head too. Like a’ almond or something?”

The ghost, almost of a wavering opacity and slight blur, stopped hovering for a moment. Its hands were tinged with pink light and twitched as if a thought had run to them but encountered an incomplete circuit.

“Maybe he’s thinking,” said Estelle.
