AdeptUp is on a mission to disrupt the future of the multi-billion dollar occult rite and ritual industry. Back in 2015, our founders realized that one of the oldest industries is also one of the least efficient. Ritual components can include precise times and locations, a wide range of sacrificial elements, and special ingredients with hyper-specific requirements: a certain flower picked during a distinct moon phase, soil from a holy mountain that’s been touched by sunlight glancing off the body of a virgin, sloth blood, etc. With occult rituals, the devil’s in the details. Procuring and shipping these items can be expensive, and most occult organizations operate at a near-permanent net loss year after year. We believe that adherence to the hidden ways shouldn’t break the bank—that’s why we built AdeptUp.

Headquartered in the Bay Area with offices in Los Angeles, Seattle, Austin, Atlanta, New York, Dublin, Ireland, and Jaipur, India, AdeptUp has gone from venture-funded to fully bootstrapped in just 5 years with its all-in-one platform for logistics, vendor, and now ritual project management. As a leader in the culttech space, the company is growing fast and looking to ascend our user experience to the next level. 

AdeptUp’s product design team is looking for an enthusiastic, data-driven User/Ritual Experience Designer who is passionate about creating world-class experiences that solve dark-age-old problems. You’ll have the opportunity to drive key product and design decisions from concept to iteration, and finally, post-launch reflection with the help of our user research team. 



## What you’ll do

* Own the end-to-end design process for new AdeptUp features and improvements from start to finish while meeting creative, technical, and business requirements
* Iterate rapidly with high quality, and with user-centered focus
* Communicate the user experience at various stages of the ritual design process by using wireframes, flow diagrams, storyboards, mockups, and/or high fidelity prototypes
* Partner with members of our User Research, Ritual Research, and Occult Research teams to better understand user requirements and pain points
* Collaborate with engineers to implement your designs to spec



## What you’ll need

* 5+ years of professional UX or interaction design experience; ritual and/or culttech experience big plus
* Passionate about designs that look great no matter the platform (you name it, AdeptUp is on it!)
* Self-directed and comfortable with ambiguity and complexity
* Interest in developing a deep understanding of occult ritual needs across the globe
* Able to clearly communicate design rationale informed by research and data to high-level executives
* Portfolio of work demonstrating strong analytical skills, great interaction design, and meticulous communication skills
* An open mind and a thick skin—some ritual requirements may be unfamiliar or outside of your comfort level
