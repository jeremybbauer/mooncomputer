excerpt: This is where, no matter how long you’ve been putting one foot in front
  of the other, how far you’ve come, the only way forward is through destructive
  deviation. Where you would rather an atom bomb was dropped on your legs than
  you move them another inch.

Her feet planted on the cool wooden slats of the bedroom floor. The sun had already begun blanketing the space with its golden July morning, adding a heat that pasted her bangs to her forehead and formed a wild halo of auburn curls in the back. As she did every morning, she walked the edges of the room to get behind the chifforobe. With her eyes just shy of closed, she pushed the chifforobe in front of the window. The sun highlighted the pregnant pine form, lending a grandeur to the antique only technically such, as it was purchased for $0.35 and was not even worth that at the time.  

Some days, it’s about routine. The best way to keep going is to put one foot in front of the other. And then again. And again. And again. And again, just like that, until you reach the chaos point. This is where, no matter how long you’ve been putting one foot in front of the other, how far you’ve come, the only way forward is through destructive deviation. Where you would rather an atom bomb was dropped on your legs than you move them another inch. Vaporization as salvation from the routine that saved you. She’d been piecing together this theory since the last time she deviated. The man at the bus station, the cleaning, the missing person’s report, and then the return to routine. 

Such returns need to account for the deviation, she’d found. While the steps are the same, the path once diverted from dulls under new light. There’s no need to fear moving backwards, as no matter how extreme the deviation, the steps are lateral.
