“Hey Diega, so is the Bermuda Triangle your mom or your dad?” asked Gary.

“It’s complicated.”

“Cool. You two are a trip, man. A grey and a triangle, uh, person. Roommates. Just livin’ like everyone else. Crazy thing.”

“Don’t you have laser eyes or something?” asked Estelle.

“You mean the Doom Gaze? It’s not lasers. It just shows you sucky futures and makes you pretty nauseous. My dad’s is worse, but it still ain’t lasers.”

“Damn,” sighed Estelle. “I really wanted to see lasers.”

“Heh, that’d be dope. Hey, have you two seen Percy?

The day looks hazy. Like a light vibration is running through everything. It makes my eyes squint and puts my body on autopilot while I try to find out if the vibration is real or not.

I saw a ghost enter the observatory. Pretty sure it’s the one from the lawn this morning. I guess I shouldn’t have yelled, “Float it elsewhere, you spooky bitch!” and thrown a boot. Diega of the Wrong Jokes at the Wrong Time. Now it’s killing my day buzz with this long, drawn out…scheme or whatevs. I just want some wasabi breadsticks from Oochie’s Pizza, a marathon of *Catfish*, and to just be a stagnant drippy couch puddle. A swamp day.

I don’t know why Gary couldn’t find this ghost. He’s a mothman, I think they can do more than just the look thing, and this floater’s hanging out in the open. I’m sure Gary’s brother’s fine and just buying sketch weed or something. Why else would Percy be in the observatory? Don’t know why a ghost would be involved, though.
