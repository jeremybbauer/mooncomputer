You have every reason to be afraid.   
The giants are coming and they’ve already taken   
Japan. They only want a fraction of the love   
birth promised. They will pick you up,   
hug your glass frame until you run down   
their torsos, over the mountains of their knees,   
until you slip beneath their feet becoming   
their coagulated path towards impossible   
peace. Some have found god in this destruction,   
hiding in the spidered basements of blind hope,   
shaking with dread and mumbling feeble   
optimism among the stench of dust and his piss.

You are stronger than that.

Within you is a being of iron and fire,   
something boiling and ready to froth   
from your form. With you, Indiana   
and the universe can transcend   
the coming light.
