A guy I used to run with for a bit ended up joining the Ogden Dunes PD. Back in the day, he was one of the street-level types just trying to keep his neighborhood safe for his mom and his three little sisters. He wasn’t flashy. At one time the papers and news sites called him "the Mass Ave. Brawler." And once they gave him that name, they assumed for some reason that he’d stay put in the same area. When he didn’t, they thought it had to be different guys cracking ribs and jaws, and they gave each of these supposed different guys nicknames too. Some of the other names they had for him were the Downtown Rager, the Demon of Fountain Square, the Tuxedo Park Breaker, and the Hook. I think the last one confused them even more, because then people were watching out for some guy with a hook lurking in alleys to hang up drug dealers and bangers by their insides or something. I heard that a few were scared so bad they left the state, though they started calling him the Hook because it was clear he had some boxing training. 

Now he’s just Ricky Zaleski, Ogden Dunes patrolman. If I was going to try looking this corydalis murder, I didn’t want the cops to know too much about what I was doing, but I needed help getting started. Since Ricky and me went back a ways, I thought he might understand. Or I could at least pay him a visit and test the waters.
