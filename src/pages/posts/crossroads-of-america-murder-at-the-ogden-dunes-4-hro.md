I stepped out into the parking lot to get some air. 

A pelican flew overhead, looking like a saxophone attached to a cloud. A small gray wisp appeared below it, sinking until the body of a thin eight-inch fish slammed against a car’s windshield. My nerves were shot from seeing Ricky, and the surprise almost knocked me down. After I got my brain back in my head, I saw that the fish was still alive, bouncing against the windshield glass. I went to see the flopping silver shock and wedged in one of the wiper blades was a cream-white pearl. 

“That looks like good luck to me. I’d keep it for myself, but you don’t take another person’s luck. Even if it did land on my own damn car.”
