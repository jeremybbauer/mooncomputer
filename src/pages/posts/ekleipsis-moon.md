“An eclipse is the best way to describe it. She had this ring of light about her and everything else was just...darkness. It was beautiful. When she turned to look at you, this wave went through you. You could feel it fill up your body and then keep on moving on. What it filled you up with, I never could tell. Whether it was the light or darkness.” 

“And this woman, you saw her at the Hammond incident? Was she involved in some way?”

“I don’t really remember. It mighta been before everything.“

“Do you remember anyone else, Laura?”

“No. Just her.”

“Did you talk to her at all? See her do anything?”

“No. I thought she spoke to me, but she didn’t. It’s hard to explain.”

“Well. I think we need to find this woman. Out of 126 people, you and this woman, presumably, were the only ones that survived whatever happened there. Now, she could’ve had something to do with it, or she’s an innocent bystander. Like you. Either way, she needs our help. Will you help us, Laura? Help us find her?”
