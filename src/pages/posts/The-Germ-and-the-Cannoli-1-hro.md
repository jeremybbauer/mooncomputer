“You know, it’s your hygiene. That’s what it is.”

“Ma, whaddoi need hygiene for, huh? Bacteria, viruses, all that stuff can’t touch me. My body actively repels it. So I don’t have to clean my apartment, my clothes, nothing. For months. And still, I don’t smell or nothin. That’s my gift, ma. Saves me a lot of time.”

“Saves you time, yeah. To do what? Eh? You, my angel, light of my life, just have sooo. Much. Potent-“

“Ma, come on, with the p-word? I do fine. Now, come on, I brought the cannolis and the coffee so you could have a nice night, okay?”

“Well…I appreciate that. Thank you. You got the good one’s too.”  
“Yeah, I got the good ones. Let’s just sit and eat these, ah?”

“Okay, okay. Thank you. But, I just want to say one thing, and then I’ll stop. You could be doing the same stuff as those other whosits I see on TV. Shakin hands with the mayor, the manager of that bus depot what was…what…set on fire or frozen solid or somethin. With your gift, that beautiful blue skin, you’re just as good as those bigwigs. And if your clothes were a little cleaner and you combed your hair, you might seem more invitin to people. That’s all I’ll say.”

“Ma, blue skin is not a tactical advantage. This much I know, okay?”

“Well, it stands out, and that’s half of it, you know. You know, I would love to have blue skin. I think it’s great. Your father and me, we couldn’t believe it. Not so much as an extra…a…a…toe or anything between us, and here were are with our first child, our baby boy, blue and gifted. Gah, you were so beautiful.”

“Ma…”

“Handsome. You were so handsome. And then we find out our first child can’t get sick? Pinch me, I’m either dreamin or dead and gone to heaven.”

“I can’t get sick. That don’t nothin for anybody else but me. Doesn’t qualify me for stopping muggings or killers or anything. I’m fine where I am, ma. Okay?”

“Well, have you ever tried, you know, makin it so others can’t get sick too? You’d have to if anyone visits that apartment of yours.”

“Ma, I don’t wanna talk anymore about this. Let’s just eat.”

“Okay, okay. Thanks for comin, Frankie.”

“Sure, ma. Every Tuesday. You got it. Love you, ma.”
