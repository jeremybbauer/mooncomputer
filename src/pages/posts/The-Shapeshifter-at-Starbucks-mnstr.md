The shapeshifter at Starbucks was of the cloud type. First, the baritone “double-tall Salted Caramel with Soy” came from a cloud of pond moss. By the time the woman with the knowledgeable aura and pale side braid marked the cup and announced the total, a credit card appeared from a mass of crystal and gold finch feathers. They seemed to be most interested in experimenting with contradictions.

This is common in shapeshifters, this constant experimentation. But I guess some of us, usually my favorites of us, are no different. It’s impolite to stare, as shapeshifters don’t shift for others. The changes are more about their own discoveries, their own scientific methods for establishing identity, than others’ attention.

I found myself hoping they would stay feather and crystal. To look at something with such stark hardness and softness stole my thoughts, stumbled my drink order.

What I find most interesting about shapeshifters of the cloud type is how they display an intricacy of shadow. No matter the material of the cloud, it is made up of part absence and part presence. For instance, the reason people are enamored with a clear night sky is the explicit scale of absence and presence. If the sky is all void, people don’t bother to look up. Same as if it’s all light. But once they can see the peppered coexistence, people will build all sorts of instruments and make all sorts of special plans to stare up at its haunting contrast. It’s the same with any cloud.

I had to keep diverting my periphery from its shifting. They were just out for some coffee, like me, and deserved as much anonymity as anyone.

When Asa, the woman of the aura, called the shapeshifter’s order up, I looked out of reflex at the direction of her raised voice. The shapeshifer had turned to millions of tiny filaments, each emanating black light except for one silver fleck in the center of the subdued multitude. The shadows were immaculate in their almost imperceptible fade from the black light. In the silver, I thought I could see myself, a gray light alone in a cosmos of like things, somehow slanted from the reality around me. A cool light. A dull light, barely seen from across the block.
