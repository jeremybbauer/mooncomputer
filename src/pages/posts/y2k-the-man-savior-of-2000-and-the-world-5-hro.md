Deshawn’s computer’s real clean so he must be super rich. I mean, I guess I knew that, but that gray plastic practically glows, so it really smacks your face about it. I don’t know if I’m scared to get closer to everyone because I don’t want an episode in front of them or if it’s cause I don’t want to get this thing dirty or something. This party’s starting to creep me out. 

“What Satanists?” I say, trying to hit a balance in my distance. 

“It says it here, man, on the newspaper’s website,” says Deshawn. “’Today in History. Satan Comes to Pleasant Lake: Occult Killing Shocks Small Town Indiana.’ Let’s see…’October, 1995’…’two found dead’…’Ritualistic in nature’…uh…They found them in the woods behind the baseball diamond. There were signs of some ritual, markings on trees, candles arranged in a symbolic pattern. Doesn’t say what a symbolic pattern is. Uh, two people were found dead at the scene with markings on their bodies. The two were local businessman James Davis and his wife Lila Davis. Coroner found that they both died due to blunt force trauma to the head, and from their toxicology report, appear to have been drugged. Shit.”

“Fuck,” says Carla.

“Jesus,” I say. I look back to see Daryl’s reaction to this spooky shit and he’s gone. I thought I would’ve heard him leave.
