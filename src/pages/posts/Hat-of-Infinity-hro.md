Most people lucky enough to find something fantastic or mystic, glory perverts, are bags of hot carnival goldfish when it comes to figuring out what to do with it. They’re all, “Oh, darn, set the Hammer of Vulcan on the back of my toilet and it went straight through all seven floors of my apartment building and now everyone has to move onnaccounta the flaming sinkhole.” Or, “Shoot! That dang Computer Mouse of the Rigel Tetrahedron Swarm what appeared to me on the city bus put my family in the *World of Warcraft*! How was I supposed to know you couldn’t spill RC Cola onnit? Mammaw’s getting chased all over by dang ol’ blood elves, and pap fell in with those nasty boys, the Horde! Granny’s fine, though. Picked so many herbs she’s level 40. I just started playing last week! I cain’t help!”

This was not the case with Leanne Kim. One day she awoke and knew what it was, what it could do, and just where to find it. There were no whispers in her dreams, no creeps in shadows being cryptic for their own mental masturbation. Leanne knew that the blue trucker cap with white embroidery reading “RETIRED” happened to be in the exact point in time and space where the infinite folded, just once. She knew that the infinite is everywhere and always, but it was also in the hat. Localized and always.

She bought the hat from the I-69 Exit 23 truck stop and put it on as she walked to her Volkswagen Golf. When first merging with the infinite, there is an accordion effect. Shimmering blue slats of you fan out linear order through all dimension, then return, stacking and folding together. Leanne Kim was the bearer of the Hat of Infinity. And she knew what to do with it.
