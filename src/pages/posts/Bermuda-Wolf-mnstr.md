It is unknown when or how Clint Fortean, the Bermuda Wolf, contracted his lycanthropic condition. Though Fortean has been described as a kind, yet somewhat despondent man by the majority of his former neighbors and community members, DNA evidence has linked Fortean to five separate murders across the Midwestern United States. Each victim was a white male between the ages of 25 and 40 with a history of assault and domestic abuse. It is unknown whether these murders were premeditated or crimes of passion, though forensic evidence suggests the latter.

The cause of death in each case was blood loss resulting from multiple lacerations to the neck and chest. Area witnesses at each scene claimed to hear shouting, followed by growling and screaming noises. A witness in Greencastle, Indiana claimed he saw seen a large animal flee the crime scene on all fours covered in a tattered Dolly Parton t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and blood. Tattered shirt and denim remnants were found at each scene, along with tufts of coarse brown hair. In Findlay, Ohio, a left Birkenstock not matching the victim was also found at the scene. Hair and flakes of skin found in the sandal matched Fortean’s DNA.

Shortly after the fifth murder, Fortean was spotted boarding a ship to Bermuda, likely in order to avoid arrest. Due to unexpected weather issues, the ship was forced to travel around to the island’s southern port, passing through the tip of the Bermuda Triangle. A witness on the ship named Roy Jordan, who’d had an argument with Fortean earlier in the day, claims to have seen an animal in shorts and a ripped Loretta Lynn shirt lunging toward him on the ship’s deck when, suddenly, a bright flash encompassed the ship. Everyone aboard the ship confirms that a mass phenomenon occurred that paralyzed both the crew and passengers for a moment before rendering them unconscious.

When Jordan came to, the animal appeared to be seizing. Jordan recognized the shirt and shorts as being identical to what Fortean was wearing during the earlier altercation. The animal had thick brown hair and moaned, seemingly in pain. Jordan noted that an unidentified low hum could be heard near the animal. This hum intensified along with the seizing for about 30 seconds before both stopped.

Jordan began backing away from the animal when it started to growl. The animal sprang to its feet and raised its head to look at Jordan. Jordan described the animal’s face in a following statement given to ship personnel on 06/03/1993:

> The damn thing was weird. It looked like…like teeth and night time. Like…the face was pitch black even when the boat lights hit it. You could still see the whites of the thing’s eyes, though, and those teeth jutted out just clear. There was these shiny white specks too, in the black part. It’s the weirdest damn thing I ever seen in my life.

The animal lunged to attack Jordan. However, just before colliding with Jordan, the hum returned, followed by a popping sound. “That’s how it was, man,” stated Jordan. “It was like, ‘Hmmmmmm. Pop!” Jordan has been given a full psychiatric evaluation and is being monitored for evidence of a psychiatric disorder. Apart from the animal incident, there is no evidence to suggest any disorder at this time.

Both the animal and Fortean were not seen on the ship again. However, over the next 3 months, Fortean seemed to relocate frequently. He was spotted in Puerto Rico, The Republic of Bulgaria, Guyana, Turkmenistan, and Iceland over a period of 6 weeks. We are still unable to find any travel records for Fortean during this time.

Though we are no closer to apprehending Fortean, we have obtained a full report from a woman in Iceland, Aleta Mínervudóttir, who claims to have been romantically involved with Fortean for three weeks before he suddenly disappeared. Mínervudóttir is a professional psychiatrist, and though she did not treat Fortean. She reported that doing so would have been an conflict of interest. She did claim that she was trying to help Fortean with personal issues.

Mínervudóttir agreed to turn over an answering machine message that Fortean left on January 10, 1994 to authorities. This message was the last contact Fortean had with Mínervudóttir:

> Used to be, I felt awful all the time. About myself, mostly. Sometimes something would come over me, and…I couldn’t help myself. I’d do stuff I regret. I would get real low about it sometimes. Dolly and Patsy and Loretta helped me through it, they’re good angels, but I didn’t know what to do with myself. Then something changed. Something happened, like an accident or something and…I’d still get that impulsive feeling come over me but I didn’t do stuff I regret. I couldn’t. Sometimes I still tried to, but I just wasn’t able to anymore. Something would stop me. At first I thought it was great. I thought I was free kinda. But then I…I just felt…I don’t know. Like I couldn’t do nothing at all. Some weird feeling of failure stuck to me that I can’t shake. I didn’t like who I was before, but what am I now? What purpose could I have? It’s like I can’t do nothing in this world to give myself even an ounce, a tiny bit of control over my own life. I can’t step to someone without ending up somewhere else. I’ve just been clipped. And I still ain’t been to Bermuda.

Fortean is still at large, and we seem to be unable to apprehend him, or even track his movements. He is to be considered dangerous and should not be approached without backup.
