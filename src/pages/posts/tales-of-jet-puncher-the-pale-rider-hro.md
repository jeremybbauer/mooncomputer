“Because of his spurs and stuff, there was this clanging when he walked. It sounded like a hammer was comin’ towards ya. white

“So, he walks up to me and he says, ‘I am blessed with purpose. A divine instinct I couldn’t fight if I wanted to. I am compelled meet those who would trespass against decency. Against good folk. People are to forgive those who trespass against them. But for me it’s different. It is for me to demonstrate the error of such trespasses. Without blindness or hesitation.’

“At that point, I was kind of spooked, you know? But not trying to show it. Guys were always saying weird stuff. A lot of ‘em liked to be real theatrical about it, and really leaned into that part. Shoulda joined a community theater or somethin’ instead of pushing over banks on flyin’-majigs or smashin’ up streets pretending to be dinosaur robots when they’re just, like, regular or real nerdy guys. But when they get to soundin’, like, biblical? I  never was much for church, but it always gave my gut this funny feeling. I don’t know what. 

“And that was the second time you got shot, Dad?”

“Eh. Might’ve been the third…But I haven’t gotten to that part yet. Um…where…oh, yeah. I said, ‘That sounds kinda preachy for a killer. I haven’t been in a church in a while, but I’m pretty sure murder’s frowned upon, there, cowboy.’ I admit, the guy was better with words than me.

“Then this jingle-jangle SOB walked closer and said, ‘God killed when he had to. He did a lot when he had to. But people call Him another name when they don’t understand his actions. When they’re scared of him. They like to act like it’s someone else doing those things because they can’t reconcile that someone good, someone who’s shown them love, can do ugly things to keep the beautiful going. Devil’s just another word for God when He does things people don’t like.’”

“Wait…He said all that? Really?”

“Hey, you know me. My memory ain’t great, but this stuff is burned in my brain exactly as I heard it all those years ago. Hand to God. Scout’s, eh…uh…whatsitcalled.”

“Honor.”

“Right, yeah. Scout’s honor.”

“Okay…then did ya get shot after that?”

“No.”

“Daaad!”

“Hey, I’m gettin’ to it, I’m gettin’ to it! Oh…geez. It’s 5:30, bud. I’m ‘sposed to get you back to your mom’s by six.”

“Oh my god.”

“Well, hey, next time believe me maybe and just listen to the story. I’ll finish it next week, okay? Trust me, that one isn’t going anywhere.”
