“What’re you doing, Gary?”

“Getting at my man Ear Medicine. Might be able to help since he’s a wizard.”

“Aw, what kind?”

“Uh…I don’t know.”

“You don’t know what your man is a wizard of? Like, you don’t know what he can do?”

“I mean, we hang, we don’t do spells and shit. We just hang out. You know, watch videos online, get some food, get at some kombuchas, play video games. One time we robbed these two, like, computer elves, but it was an accident. Anyway, Ear Medicine’s good people. Surprised you haven’t met him, Estelle.”

Why do things have to be so hard? Especially when I haaaaate them.

This observatory’s jank. The door’s stuck, feels like it’s welded shut. But I just saw the ghost go in and the door just kinda shut behind it. Ooo, that ghost better not just be holding it shut on the other side. Ghosts usually don’t have so much…autonomy, but something’s off about this one. I don’t see any of this being its routine while it was alive or anything. And it isn’t quite acting like a woke ghost.

I think I’ll have to port everyone in. Should be okay, but I’m still not used to it. I’m not used to the sound of me. Not like hearing yourself on a recording and being like, “Oh, is that what I really sound like? I sound so weird!” When I use the energy, it sounds like two bug zappers colliding underwater. That, plus the feeling of it is just, I don’t know, uncomfortable.

I concentrate, do my breathing exercises. I feel the lines of the triangle under my clothes being traced by the energy. It finishes the shape and then pulses slowly at first, like an electric heartbeat, then the pulse gets deeper. It feels somewhere between your leg falling asleep and grabbing an electric fence. Tingles. Current. No pain, though.

I concentrate on where I want to go and push the energy to project in front of me.

“That’s good for about a minute, so let’s see if your dumbass brother’s in here.   
…  
Shit, I take that back, Gary. Sorry. I just really want breadsticks.”
