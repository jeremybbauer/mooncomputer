Smoke filled the field from the lurching shape’s barrage. Flashes of gunfire and blue energy cracked through the chaotic mist, appearing as a thunderstorm churning towards me. The ships above were forced to scatter as they dropped left and right like a fogger truck catching up to a swarm of mosquitoes. 

A strange gust manifested, further agitating the attack pattern in the sky. Then it moved to the ground and tossed the stranded runners. When the mysterious wind met the blasting clouds of the coming shape, I could finally see what had arrived: hope and hellfire.

“We’re pitchin’ in, kid! And I don’t mean my famous potato salad!”

It was the Manahans from a few lots over, yelling from the loudspeaker of their canary yellow double-wide now full trailer mech wreaking sweet, deadly havoc.

“‘Preciate it, Mr. Manahan! Hope Mrs. Manahan’s doing alright!” I yelled back through my mech's speaker.

“She’s just fine. Currently handing these things their asses while I do the driving.”

“Always did like you, Mrs. Manahan. Give ‘em fresh hell.”

They went on blasting and moving forward. I couldn’t believe it. Another shape appeared behind them. This one was olive with a big turbine on the front of it, which explained the wind. 

I yelled through my speaker, “A sight for sore eyes as always, Thuy!”

“Today I’m ‘Momma Rage’! Kids are napping, so I’m free for some neck snapping!”

“Damn. That’s some energy. Get at those necks, Momma Rage!”
