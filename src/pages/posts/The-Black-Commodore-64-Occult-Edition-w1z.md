Personal computers are supposed to empower all persons. Not just the already powerful. Not the adept, or persons of charmed ancestries. They’re supposed to be for everyone.

But who is designing for the people with mystic affinities? IBM, Apple, and the other big names don’t seem concerned with meeting the needs of those in the occult industry. They think in one plane, one dimension, when we know there are more.

Finally, computing power is being made available to practitioners of the arcane arts. It’s the Black Commodore 64, Occult Edition. This isn’t a computer that can barely hold a spreadsheet of your initiate numbers and oblation logs. With a 65K memory, it can withstand more summoning rituals and ancient rites that other home computers can’t.

Like any industry’s tools, your computer needs to be able to adapt to different tasks and changes in the industry landscape. The Black Commodore 64 is already a robust machine, especially with its two built-in scry-crystal ports. However, if you ever want to broaden the Black Commodore’s capabilities, a line of peripherals specific to the occult is available. Multiplanar modems. Five-port artifact hub. Disk drives. And printers, with choice of black ink or monk’s blood cartridges.

And it’s not just the processing power that allows the Black Commodore to manage arcane organizations from small to large, even international. The price makes it affordable for any sect.

There’s no reason that people should have to practice the arcane arts without cutting edge technology. With the Black Commodore 64, Occult Edition, those whom prefer to operate in the shadows don’t have to sacrifice efficiency. Commodore makes computers for everyone.
