A cloud of mosquitoes rested round her like…I don’t know, some kinda…bathrobe or something. I don’t know what all c’n rest around people. She wasn’t bothered by the cloud. She took a step towards the truck and they moved with ‘er. They gave her this kind of gray glow and her eyes held on to the gleam a’ the moonlight.

As she got closer she started whisperin’ to herself. We couldn’t quite make it out over the sharp buzz. But then that skeeter aura started…oh…whatsit…Oss…Oscillate? That ain’t right. What…Undulate! Those skeeters started undulatin’ around her. Then they’d expand and get a couple feet from her on both sides. Then return.

The whisper got louder. It almost seemed like it started to mix with the sound of them flyin’ things. Finally, we could hear it:

“I am the queen of the tiny things. Teensy, bitsy, with venom and sting.  
I am the queen of the tiny things. Flying, crawling, in the night I sing.  
I am the queen of the tiny things. Teensy, bitsy, with venom and sting.”
