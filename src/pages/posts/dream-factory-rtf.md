6 AM t’ 3, every day. Go to the factory, run the screw gun, lunch, run the screw gun some more. Up and down, up and down all day with that damn thing hanging from the ceiling like fly paper. 

In the summer, it gets so hot in there you need to be up on yer Mount’n Dews to make sure ya don’t collapse and crack yer melon or get something caught in something worse. They roll out these huge fans, but they don’t do much. ‘Cept fer lettin’ you know Tandy didn’t forget his liter of Brute that morning or remind you that Kris don’t believe in using deodorant. 

Sometimes, it gets so hot I start to see things. Once it looked like the convey’r belt was melting. Another time I thought my arms and soul were made of light and no one coulda told me differ’nt. And then this one time, I saw the baby Jesus peakin’ out from the brake-pad stamper. You could just tell it was him. 

I don’t tell nobody about this stuff, though. I still gotta eat no matter what I see. And I know it’s just the heat, ya know? But sometimes...that stuff just gets into me. Gets into my head. I start thinkin’ about it at the supper table. When I lay down at night. When I get ready to do the same shit the next day. 

Lots of folks would like to see Jesus. Just once. I know Mom would. The Tuttle Twins over near Birdseye. Guess I might could have some questions myself. 

Supposed to be a hot one tomorrow. So, I guess we’ll see what we see.
