![glitched alley covered in graffiti with two people at the end](https://res.cloudinary.com/mooncomputer/image/upload/c_scale,h_794,q_auto:best/v1561926132/Moon%20Computer%20Blog/RTF/cheat-wink--linda-xu-133648-unsplash--moshed.jpg "Cheat Wink")

job and god were playing\
handball against their\
apartment building.

job told god he couldn’t\
use telekinesis, which\
made god sad because

he couldn’t get his hands\
to grow past the size\
of a toddler’s.

when god thought of this,\
his hands shrank to fetal.

job was running the wall,\
making it rain\
aces and bullets.

god alchemized a few bricks\
super rubber and pulled off\
the fabled roller.

when job saw the cheat-wink,\
he called bullshit.

god called nuh-uh, grew horns\
and hooves, shot blue flames

from his nostrils\
and eyes.

then god went dove-faced\
and said, “job, i…think\
i’m…pregz.”

“you say that every time\
you lose,” said job.

god sulked, turned cloud\
and showered molasses

all the way up\
the graffitied stairs.

he turned on shark week,\
changed to gasoline fumes

and took a deep\
breath of himself,

hovering over the couch\
as he forgot about the world.

and job returned to the\
community center

where he tended the pool\
and hid light along

the pockets of deep\
darkness.
