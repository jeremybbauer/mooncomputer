Job and god were playing  
handball against their  
apartment building.

job told god he couldn’t  
use telekinesis, which  
made god sad because

he couldn’t get his hands  
to grow past the size  
of a toddler’s.

when god thought of this,  
his hands shrank to fetal.

job was running the wall,  
making it rain  
aces and bullets.

god alchemized a few bricks  
super rubber and pulled off  
the fabled roller.

when job saw the cheat-wink,  
he called bullshit.

god called nuh-uh, grew horns  
and hooves, shot blue flames

from his nostrils  
and eyes.

then god went dove-faced  
and said, “job, i…think  
i’m…pregz.”

“you say that every time  
you lose,” said job.

god sulked, turned cloud  
and showered molasses

all the way up  
the graffitied stairs.

he turned on shark week,  
changed to gasoline fumes

and took a deep  
breath of himself,

hovering over the couch  
as he forgot about the world.

and job returned to the  
community center

where he tended the pool  
and hid light along

the pockets of deep  
darkness.
