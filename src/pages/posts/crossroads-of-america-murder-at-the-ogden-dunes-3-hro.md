After about a four-hour drive, I met Ricky at a little diner, The Beach Cafe. It looked like one of those places that tried to be retro 10 years ago, and so had become some weird accident in time. Like someone who’d stood still while the years swelled at first against their back and then fell all around them before they realized they were deep in the distance from where they thought they were. There seemed to be a lot of places like that around there. 

The smell of burgers, and fries, and coffee lifted me up and carried me all the way to a booth by the window. My stomach was a gaping hole for burning comfort food. And pie. When Ricky came to the booth I realized I’d forgotten all about being in detective mode. I wasn’t paying attention to shit, but I needed to be.

“Hey, Ed.”

“Hey, Ricky!” 

When I called Ricky a few days ago about visiting, he seemed surprised. Not really excited, but not like he felt put out or anything. Maybe even a little curious. In the diner, though, his face looked hard. All the muscles tense with a look in his eyes that gave me flashbacks to seeing him take on five guys with knives and bats at once near Fountain Square. Something had made him feel like he had to fight.

“So, how’s it go--“ 

“Look, Ed. I don’t see ya or hear from ya in five years, and all the sudden you wanna drive four hours to have a pork tenderloin and a coffee. Which doesn’t go together.”

“I told you, man, I needed a vacation and I’ve been meaning to get up here and see how you’re doing, check out the beach. You know.”

“Yeah. And I was thinking after we got off the phone how we haven’t had any contact but you decide to visit me right when there’s been a murder in town, one that’s been made public and everything. I know what this is.”

“Ricky, I...I mean, I did hear about that, but I wanted to visit. It’s been a long time.”

“Well, I’m not saying you were lying or that you are now. And that makes it worse. You’re trying to use me, but you don’t call it that, wouldn’t think of calling it that. You’re too up in the clouds for that. But you are. You use people and think you’re doing some higher thing.”

I don’t think he’s going to slug me in this diner, but I’m keeping his fists in my periphery. 

“Look. Have your coffee, your tenderloin, fries. Have some pie. The rhubarb and pecan are good. But I don’t want to staying here or gettin’ involved in things that don’t concern you.”

“Hey, man, you don’t want to see me, that’s cool. The hotel will charge me if I leave now, but I’m only going to be here a few days and I’ll stay out of your way. Okay? You won’t see me.”

“Ed. I mean it.”

The gaping, burning whole returned to replace my stomach again as Ricky walked out of the diner, one hand raised without looking for acknowledgement and a waitress and a cook waiving back without receiving their own.
