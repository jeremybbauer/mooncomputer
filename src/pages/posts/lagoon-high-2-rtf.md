“So, Mr. Kelly, I’m afraid I can’t work this job no more. It’s a safety issue. But I’m only gonna charge you for the chemicals and just a little of the labor so far, but not all of it. I’m sorry I couldn’t help more.”

“You’re sorry? Jesus Christ. Well, what the hell am I supposed to do, guy? Now I got this damn, uh, infected pool or what the hell ever, costing me my best janitors and now also costing me…Give that here. Shit. Also costing me $603.11 with nothing to god damn show for it.”

“Mr. Kelly, sir, I know you’re in a bind, I so. And I’m really sorry. I wish I could help ya. But…I got a wife, okay? And we don’t have kids but we been thinking about it. And we do have two dogs. It’s just…I’m sorry, it ain’t worth it.”

“Ain’t worth it? What about all the god’amn kids in this school, huh? Are they not worth you cleaning this shit up? You want me close down the school for this so they’re all fucking behind the rest of the year and the years after? So some of them have to stay all day at their shitty homes where they can barely eat a PB and fucking J without having lit cigarettes thrown at them?”

“Mr. Kelly, I’m sorry, I…”

“You’re not. Get out. And if you ask me to pay this horseshit bill again me and this school will sue you for endangering the lives of children by not doing your fucking job. And I’ll personally come to your house and steal your goddamn dogs cause obviously being a rational human being is too fucking hard for you and I don’t trust your ability to take care of them.”

The pool cleaner, Ronn the invoice said, took off his ball cap and scratched his head. He looked towards the pool, which gave him a feeling he couldn’t describe if he wanted to, and couldn’t tell another soul. Not even his wife Simone whom he loved more than he thought he could, not even his dogs, no judgement just furry acceptance in love. Not the second most pissed man he’s ever seen in his life standing right in front of him. 

He looked at the kids milling around. His mind became a casserole of the carefree memories of his own childhood, some real some painted much brighter by time, and what he’d imagined his own kids lives may be like someday.  What his family could’ve been if he hadn’t gotten a late start on doing life right and what his family still could be. Nostalgia and hope bobbed alongside fear and regret.

Ronn looked back at the pool and felt as if it was spilling into him. A little with each second, filling the container of him. Something beautiful and dark and terrible was in that pool. It pulled at him like a foreboding tide. Ronn felt it wash against him inside, and he knew that if he stayed around it any longer, something would change. He wasn’t strong enough. 

“It’s a bum deal, Mr. Kelly. I’m sorry. It’s not something I want to do, leaving a job unfinished. I take pride in my work. But I just can’t do this one and that’s that.”

“Okay, well, I didn’t tell you to get out so that you could stay and tell me more stuff to infuriate me. Just…just fucking go now, please. I got third period coming up.”
