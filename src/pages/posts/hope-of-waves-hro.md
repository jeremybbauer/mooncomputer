The white flash of light warns that they're gaining on her. Through the exit door, down the long stairwell, and across the beach of black sand is all that's left. Then she'll be at the warm ocean. Disappear into the waves. She thinks of their throats and where to hit, which areas kill and which slow movement. As she bursts though the door, so hard her shoulder is almost shifted from the socket, she hears a crack. Another brief flash of light blips at the furthest edge of her periphery. Something blunt moves across the flesh of her ribs, carving its trajectory before pinging against the door metal. She hears its faint whisper continue outside the building. Showing her the way.
