There was a time when most movements, trends, societal achievements, etc., bled here and there into the occult world, but since the 1970s and 80s, they occur in both worlds almost simultaneously. One of the more interesting occurrences of this to watch unfold was the boom of home computing during the 1980s and 90s. It was fascinating, confounding, and horrifying all at once, as these things often are. 

As you likely know, those goofed on eldritch energies or hungry for the flesh of the word arenâ€™t just the gray hermits in the woods or the matted-haired answers to why animals and children keep disappearing near certain storied cave systems. They are of all types, all walks of life. To the eternal bane of goodness and our chance at a peaceful world, practitioners of the occult are often either attracted to power or freedom, and routinely the former disguised as the latter (good old subconscious!). So, while people warmed up to the idea of bringing home these clacky televisions with brains to entertain their kids and help them beat the stock market into spewing its riches on their burnt-orange carpeted floors, these same people started wondering how computers might improve all areas of their lives. Even the darker, secret places.
