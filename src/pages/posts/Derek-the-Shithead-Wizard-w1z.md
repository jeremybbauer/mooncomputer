Derek said he’s a wizard now. I said “fuck you, Derek, you know I was gonna try to be a wizard next week and when I told you you looked at me like a dumb shithead with rude opinions.” Derek shrugged his shoulders like a shithead. I told Janice on our computer date and she told me my ponytail was shit and that she’d wizard me up tomorrow. She’s real good and that’s why we’re friends but I told her to fuck a hot wire for dumping on my ponytail. She laughed and I said sorry and took another Kool-Aid chug. She said to come to her basement at 10:07 A.M. with noodles and a tracksuit (on) and she’ll wizard me the fuck up till I’m like some kinda rainbow coming out of a volcano on the god damn moon. Beautiful carnage. I said, “YES!!!” and judo’ed around till the glitter bowl was everywhere and my sparkle kicks killed a Precious Moments dingus.

Tomorrow will be a great day. I cannot wait to reach my potential.

Fuck Derek.
