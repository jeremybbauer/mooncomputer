The door was stuck, but Lacey’s a tank. She threw the then empty peppermint schnapps bottle she’d swiped from her brother, who swiped it from their parents, at the wooden clown sign that told kids whether they were too short for the rides. The way a few of the glass shards stuck in the clown’s face felt like justice. 

“Sweet,” said Lacey, smiling at the clown. She crouched with her hands on the ground like a football player getting ready for the snap. She stared at the door. Her eyes looked hungry. I was pretty buzzed, so I was trying to hold in a giggle fit. She stared for kind of a while before tearing off like a rhino towards the door. Then, *bam*! Lacey hit the door hard and bounced off onto her back. “Fucking ow,” she said.

The arcade door creaked opened towards us. “Shit,” I said. “It was pull instead of push.”

“Fucking doors. Why don’t all doors just go both ways? How the hell is that so hard?”

“Lacey, you beautiful moon goddess: it’s because people, including door…scientists, or whoever makes them, are stupid. They’re all jags with butts for brains that don’t deserve our genius.”

“True, true,” said Lacey. She got up, dusted the dirt off her ass, and readjusted her overall straps. 

I started walking towards her and saw something on the ground next to the tilt-a-whirl controls. “Oh, shit! There’s a crowbar over here,” I said.

“Perfect.”

“Oh, maybe we can see if any of the games still have any money in them.”

“Shit, good idea! I owe my brother gas money. He’s being a real chode about it.”

I picked up the crowbar and said, “Well then let’s get this chode paid.” Lacey laughed, and I tried not to do the same. I was feeling very action movie. I kept my eyes focused on the door and squinted a bit to keep cool. I felt pretty tough until we got to the door. 

The arcade was darker than the other buildings in the park. I forgot that it was the only building without windows. I took a few steps in and expected it to smell musty, but it didn’t. I went to open the door a little more to let in some light when I noticed the low hum.
