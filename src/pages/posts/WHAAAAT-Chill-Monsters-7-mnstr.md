“No, come on, we need some answers,” said Diega.

“So, I’m kinda new to ghosts. I thought they talked,” said Gary.

“They do. I don’t know what’s wrong with this one. It’s gettin’ on my nerves, though. Hey, come on—”

As Diega grabbed the ghost’s hand, it looked terrified. Eyes as wide as they could go, a high-pitched, almost electronic whine emitted from its body. It seemed to be seizing.

The ghost’s light pulsed, changing colors. All anyone could do was stare at the spectacle. The ghost met Diega’s eyes as it shook and strobed. The whine grew, filling the room until the ghost looked straight up with its eyes closed and its teeth clenched, casting a final burst of pink light.

“Fuck!” said Diega, finally able to take her hand from the now suspended form.

“I don’t like none of this,” said Gary.

“I can’t tell how I feel. I mean, it was cool and I did record it for my Instagram story, but all the vague makes me feel…itchy,” said Estelle.

“Did someone hit pause or something? What’s this weird-ass thing doing now”

“He’s…disrupted, Gary. It’ll pass. I’ve seen it before. It’ll take a bit, though. Can you help us get it back to me and Estelle’s?”

Diega picked up a pair of hypercolor sweatpants from the floor and threaded her arms through the legs. Without putting her hands through the feet holes, she pushed against the ghost to find it would move and hover where it was motioned, as she thought it would.

“Yeah, I can help. But then I gotta get back to finding my brother. There’s some bad shit out tonight and he ain’t smart enough to avoid it. So, we just push it all the way back?”

“Yep.”

“Okay, you two push. I’ll order carryout since we’re going that way.”

“Fuck yes, Estelle. Blessed be. Oochie’s Pizza? Finally get those damn wasabi breadsticks and some ‘za?”

“Fuck yep, mama!”

“You’re too good for this world, E.”

“Ugh, you’re telling me.”
