I never apologized for when I became an insect   
fallin’ from the pines to get tangled in your  
infinite pale braid, or for that time I shuffled   
away from your birthday dance party into the  
supple drizzlin’ dark.

And I didn’t want to share my double-wide   
with you or anyone. When you knock on the   
wood-paneling you can still hear the echo   
of Dad’s thunder, feel the dents from where a cloud   
couldn’t fit between four walls of hot aluminum.

The ceilin’ still holds the yellow rings spread above  
each chair like a dissected tree or a series of Venn   
diagrams. Dad always said a man has to stand by   
his decisions, shit or not, and you know I can’t have   
you see me cook again.

We’re two fields, Sky Pony. You’re growin’ one   
way and I another. You stay at that school, I’m where   
I ought to be. Tell your dad I didn’t mean no harm.   
He’ll get money for some new glasses, too. I swear,   
I didn’t mean no harm.

Forever, Johnny
