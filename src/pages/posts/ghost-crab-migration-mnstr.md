Each year, hundreds of luminous skitters boil out of the night waves and into the world for their migration. Through rocks, through walls, through sleeping bodies that shake and dream of rising water and sand, they walk to an island forest. The legged aurora undulates along some unknown path most of the night, until arriving at some center we don’t understand. Once they arrive, they don’t feed. They don’t mate. They stand, as if paused, with empty eyestalks twitching towards no particular vacancy. As if awaiting one last arrival. It hasn’t come, and as far as we know, it never has. When tangerine and tea rose light begins to pierce the canopy above, the faint, gleaming cast melt into mist, one by one. Their swell glides through the air towards the ocean, breaking in a whisper and the briefest glow.
