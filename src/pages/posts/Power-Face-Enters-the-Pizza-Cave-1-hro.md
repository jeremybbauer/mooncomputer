“I hate this.”

“Whaddya mean you hate it? Nothing’s even happened yet.”

“No, I hate this. I know when I hate something, and this is it.”

“Come on, it might not be too bad.”

“No, it’s just…It’s ridiculous.”

“Could be worse! It could be a, uh, a murder cave or somethin’. A cave of horrors or…knife cave. Would you rather have that, a knife cave?”

“Yes! I would. A knife cave or murder cave I can handle. It’s straightforward. But this? I don’t know what the hell’s in there.”

“I don’t mind a pizza cave. Smells pretty good. Looks like classic pepperoni. No fuss. Maybe we won’t have to get dinner later.”

“What kind of weirdo has reality-altering…whatever, hides out in a cave by the ocean, and turns the cave walls to pizza? I have no idea what could happen in there and it seems more and more likely it’ll be something worse than I can imagine. I can imagine dying, getting stabbed but good. Getting stabbed makes sense.”

“You think…whoever’s in there might turn us into pizzas? Some kind of pizza wizard?”

“Jesus, I hope it isn’t going to be all pizza-based. Who doesn’t love a good slice, you know, but if they start doing silly pizza shit in there, I’m leaving. I don’t care what happens, it gets silly, I get gone.”

“Hey, maybe it’ll be a good story. Somethin’ to tell the grandkids someday! If you ever have kids.”

“Just because you have kids doesn’t mean everyone else has to. I’m focusing on my career.”

“Hey, and I’m not? Just cause I got kids at home doesn’t mean I’m stagnant, or whatever. I got plans. ‘Sides, I gotta think about career too. Damn college tuition costs another $10,000 every time I hear about it.”

“Okay, I didn’t mean anything. Sorry, it’s just…this feels like a joke.”

“Maybe it is, to whoever’s in there. Whaddo we care, eh? It’s still a job worth doin’. Keep people from being hurt by whatever’s in there. Could even be an accident, you know? Some poor kid finds an old necklace, or gets zapped by something, and next thing they know they’re hungry and the walls suddenly turn to pizza. Or…you know. They accidentally blow up their own house while they’re asleep.”

“Yeah. That was a bad one.”

“Yeah, it was. Keeps me up sometimes. The fires. The kid. Someone could need help in there, Sid.”

“*Sigh.* Okay. You’re right, Eth. Okay. Let’s just…take a second.”

“Sure, sure.”

“Hphhh…Okay. Let’s do this. Power Face and Supercomputer. Another one for the books.”

“Damn right, Sid. Oh, and I’m gonna need you to come over for dinner next week. Make it Thursday.”

“Eh…we’ll see.”

“Okay. But Dhruv already got the stuff and he wants to cook for ya.”

“Just…let’s just do this and worry about that later.”

“Okay, okay. Cool, cool…But you’re comin’ this time.”

“Jesus, Eth! Okay, I’m going in.”

“Yeah, okay.” Supercomputer pumps her fist. “Let’s go! Whoo!”
