Alexei Zachman loved three things: computers, his family, and Setianism, an offshoot of Satanism that posits the devil is really the Egyptian god Set, and also he and God are BFFEs and the two good dads of humanity. In my experience, Setians tend to be a little more agreeable than Satanists—less costume and ego and trying to get everyone to try their sex. And while Alexei kept his religion a secret from his family, there wasn’t any interference for the most part. But Alexei was smart, very curious, and had some things he’d never dealt with, as most of us do. 

Alexei loved his life, but at the same time felt an expanse forming within, a black hole disappearing all matter and light that came near it. Some days, when enjoying time with his wife and three children or even with his programming work, Alexei forgot about this black hole and soaked in bliss. The bad days often looked the same on the surface, had all the makings of a good day, but turned Alexei into a dark cloud holding in pressures systems and gale-force winds. Alexei tried to take himself further in the teachings of Setianism instead of seeking help, and after that wasn't enough, he found himself in the world of black market antiquities trading. 

If this is starting to sound like a PSA for mental health and therapy, fucking good. This may be the only good thing that can come from this book and the world of the mystic and occult. Everyone’s got their own black holes, and therapy can save your life even if you didn’t know it needed saving. Get a therapist, then tell your friends to get this book so they can be told to get a therapist too. You're all worth it, as was Alexei. 

Alexei become obsessed with finding _real_ mystical artifacts. He was lucky his salary was good, because 99.9999% of antiquities are just old crap at exorbitant prices with no power or significance to it. Chalk it up to straight-up lies and occasional delusion, the usual suspects of the occult world. Unfortunately, in November 1994, Alexei defied probability and found what he was looking for.
