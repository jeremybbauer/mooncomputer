A wave of heat ripples over her face as she enters the room. It’s much larger than it seemed it’d be from outside the door. The walls are gray cinderblock and grow darker the closer they get to the giant furnace in the middle of the back wall, a sooty shadow or a black hole in the midst of gulping down starlight.

A man in welding boots stands over a workbench full of some kind of scrap metal. His size seems to fluctuate, in a way. Sometimes he looks huge, and she thinks she remembers him being smaller. Other times, he looks the size of a normal, yet still big man, but she thinks she remembers him being smaller.

The flames from the furnace quiver light and shadow over his blue flannel, Carhartt beanie, and dusky face as they do her jean jacket studded with enamel pins of alien abductions and women licking knives.

“I know what you’re here for,” he says. “This shit’s getting old, but you people keep coming.”

“Wha--”

“You know, once a year, I shed my skin. And then I destroy it. Know why? It’s because humans are creeps. It didn’t take long for people to start trying to steal pieces of it for weapons, armor, whatever. That was bad enough. I saw a wizard get his throat cut with a sharpened piece of my ear lobe. Fucked up. And that’s not the worst of it.

“It didn’t take long for me to start burning my skin after I shed it so the weirdoes wouldn’t take it and do awful things with it. Then, one year, I’m burning my skin and I didn’t notice that a part fell off when I picked it up. So, I’m, like, dusting off my hands from the ash blowback from throwing it in the furnace, and I look down, and there’s one of you. They snuck in, grabbed it up, and tried to run away with it. And you know what part it was? The penis part. I mean…My good god. The pervert!”

In flashes the man appears chitinous, an obsidian carapace with burning orange eyes and a body that looks half thorny crawdad and half man. A centaur of the sea. Like his size, these flashes turn to unsure memories.

“I’ll give you a piece of my skin, because I know what you’re trying to do. But not the penis part.”

“I…I didn’t want the penis part,” she says.

“Yeah. I’m sure.”
