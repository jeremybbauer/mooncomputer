Deshawn’s basement is choice. Only *good* velvet paintings, of cool shit like tigers and this one of a beach at night with a giant flame in the middle. He’s so cool it makes me uncomfortable.

On the way down the stairs, I see something move out of the corner of my eye. I try to look, but I can’t focus on it at first. And then it grows. It’s black and spinning and I think, “Fucking, again,” and it’s so annoying at this point I’m not even scared I’m losing my shit anymore.

Deshawn moves past a pool table and some mounted fish towards a computer, and I rush to a couch in case I need to say I passed out. The black orb spins and grows larger in the room and again no one sees it. I focus on the flame velvet painting and the maplewood paneling behind it.

The orb grows until it’s everything, all I can see again. I feel something like electricity reverberating my insides with the revolutions of the black mass. Like it speeds up my atoms or something and then puts them on pause over and over. I try to think about Carla, but this thing is too much. The flame velvet painting flashes in my head sometimes too, and at first I think that means I’m coming out of it, but it’s something different. The painting has a black glow when it flashes, and then the flame comes alive and burns and I feel all of it, the glow and the heat and the burning deconstruction.

Each of these episodes is feeling longer. I’m not sure if one’s gonna play me for keeps. The orb keeps spinning. The computer screen from the library earlier appears in the distance of the orb-space. As soon as I notice it, I’m tossed forward into the screen’s static. The painting fire appears again, and then I’m returned to the static. The orb returns, then it returns me to the fire, then the static, then the orb, and on and on, and if I can fucking puke in here I’m gonna.

A high-pitched whine starts because why wouldn’t this get more annoying, then there’s that wind-sucking sound again and I’m back in the basement. Everyone’s crowded around Deshawn at the computer except for Daryl who’s sitting next to me, staring at me like he just saw a truck swallowed by a sinkhole.

He whispers, “Bud, dang! Hey! Hey, bud! Ya ok’y?”

“Who *is*, even?” I say, playing it so party-cool, I think.

“You’ben starin’ at that velvet thing for 25 minutes, man. And’jer pupils are so big I though you’s havin’ a stroke or somethin’.”

“Nah, I’m cool, man. Just too many shots from the jump. I’m cool, I’m cool.”

“Ya, uuuhh, ya wanna leave? It’s ok’y, bud. I got plen’y of chicken fingers at my place and stuff. I could keep an eye on ya.”

“I’m good, I’m good. It’s cool. What are they all at the computer for?”

Daryl looked nervous. Probably worried for me, I guess. He rubs the back of his neck and winces like when he isn’t sure about something.

“Ah, they’re lookin’ up that baseball diamond stuff. From way back.”

“What stuff?”

“Oh, ya don’t know about it? It’s, uh, from way back. There’s that woods around the baseball diamond by the element’ry school. Folks say there was some kinda…uh, bad stuff that went on there. Real bad stuff.”

“Never heard about that. Wait, how do you know? You didn’t move here till a few years ago.”

“Oh, yeah…Well, someone at work told me about it.”

I don’t know if I’m being weird or he’s being weird. I don’t care, though. I just need to get through the night and the party. Without feeling like I choked it here.

“So, bad how? Like, did someone get bloodied up or murdered or something?”

“Yeah. Murdered. An’…weird stuff.”

Carla must see us talking, cause she yells over, “Hey, you guys know about this?”

“About what?” I say.

“The Satanists. The Satanists from the baseball diamond,” says Deshawn.
