He disguised it as a coffee mug that on one side displayed the words, “Pobody’s Nerfect” and on the other showed an alpaca shrugging. Absurdity is a valuable tool for obfuscation. The Chalice of Obliviatus is said to “summon a great power within you.” Whomever got that saying going must have been a huge dick. While it is true in the literal sense, using the chalice summons an extra-dimensional entity the size of a Mini Cooper inside the user’s body. This summoning paints the walls, if you catch my drift.

The entity is all smoky tendrils and mindfuck. It appears slightly different for everyone, sometimes even changing between moments. For one El Paso, Texas tarantula farmer, it looked like a cloud of computer glitch. After contact with the entity, he was not able to be separated from his basement walls and glass frog collection. For a Reykjavik startup CEO, she saw a large, pulsating black spot with flecks of starlight floating towards her four feet off the ground. She could not be separated from her custom made marble and cedar credenza, foyer mirrors, and minimalist steel and applewood shelving littered with succulent terrariums. Expansion, then fusion.

Tuttlebaum disguised the chalice because there was simply no destroying it. One person undertook a four-month journey to throw the thing into an active volcano. The damn thing just sat on top of the lava unfazed. Poor bastard.
