All my life I wanted to have something I really love. I haven’t loved anything. My family all have something. Something real special and important to them. 

For my mom, it’s plates. *Star Trek*, *Designing Women*, former presidents, she even has one with the face of some baby she doesn’t know. Dad had the beanie babies. There were so many times I couldn’t use the phone after Dad got home from work because he was eBay battling for a “genuine” Garcia the bear or that bull with the different feet, a coozied can of Mountain Dew on his right and a plate of spaghetti or leftover casserole on his left. Once I fell asleep in my closet with the cordless turned on, long story, and he was panic searching the whole house cause he couldn’t dial up with the phone line busy. He said it cost him an elephant one, but it was okay. Though he wasn’t the same for a couple of days.

My brother Drew had windbreakers and things with religious faces in them. You know, Jesus in a Cheeto, the Virgin Mary in the burn mark on a pizza pan. We weren’t religious, so I don’t know why he liked them.

My uncle Dale liked to joke that he collected divorces. He’d laugh real big about that. Then he’d stare at the ground a few seconds and say he had to leave. 

I tried collecting on my own a few times. Matchbox cars was the first. But after I got to four, I realized I didn’t care about cars. I thought about comic books, but you can’t really collect them anymore. You can, but none of them are rare except the old stuff I don’t have any connection to. I didn’t see the point. 

One time there was this misunderstanding with a kid at school, like in fifth grade, and he said he wanted to fight me. His knuckle grazed my cheekbone before a teacher saw. It wasn’t bad, but it purpled up a bit, and I thought that maybe fighting should be my thing. Maybe I could collect bruises. But that felt dumb. Maybe I was scared, I don’t know, but I didn’t see the point in that either. 

I gave up trying for a while. Then a few months ago I started hearing about crystals. They seemed alright. Some of them looked cool. I went to one of those shops with crystals, incense, and silky scarves and shit. There were so damn many crystals, though. I didn’t know what to do. 

I asked the shop guy about this milky white but kind of clear one with, like, green and blue and orange and pink hues, depending on the angle of the light. “Opal” something, I don’t remember. I asked if there was anything special about it. He talked about chakras and meridians and it was real daunting. He said it was supposed to help with energy blockages and communication. I wanted to think rude, but he was nice enough.

I said, “What? How…does it do that?” 

“We’re all products of the earth, brother,” he said. “We got minerals in us, you know. Iron, calcium. You know. Crystals just connect your body back to that. Balances everything out.”

“Oh, okay” I said. “Got it, got it. Cool. But…uh…how?”

“Just hold it in your hand, man. As tight as it feels comfortable.” For a second I thought of asking, What if you’ve never felt comfortable? I don’t think I’d ever thought that before. He asked which one of the crystals first caught my eye, cause that’s the one that was speaking to me. He said I should try it out, try to hold it. 

I took the crystal and squeezed it in my hand. It was smooth, and fit nice between my fingers and palm. I didn’t feel anything, though. I thought my hand started to tingle, but I wasn’t sure if it was just nerves, if the feeling was even real. But then it felt empty again like everything else. And I felt like this guy could see it, or was afraid he could. Sometimes it feels like people are looking at you deeply, like there’s some moment happening you weren’t prepared for. Then time fades back in and it was just you, caught in your own moment, or feeling or whatever. 

Trying to hold down a panic, I bought the not-opal thing and thanked the guy and tried to get out of there as fast as I could. This woman was coming into the shop at the same time and we collided. My wallet flung from my hand, past her, and into the street. She had a tote bag that hit my chest like a bag of fucking hammers. It fell off her arm onto the sidewalk with a crash that made my body seize up. These green, gold, blue, and black shards shot up between us. I closed my eyes just in time and felt particles sprinkle my eyelids and cheeks. I heard the lady scream. I opened my eyes and couldn’t see her anywhere. My wallet was in the street, the tote and crystal shards were on the ground, but the lady wasn’t anywhere. 

Across the street, this old guy with a yellow flannel shirt and was staring my way. He just looked at me for a few seconds. My voice hadn’t returned yet. Then the guy nodded to me, turned away, and started walking down the sidewalk like he was going about his day. I looked around the corner of the building, down a few streets, and there was no screaming lady running wildly away from an accidental and minimal confrontation. I went home and laid in my bed trying to sleep. 

I didn’t care about finding something to collect really after that. I started journaling, which I guess is collecting, in a sense. I've been thinking about my Uncle Dale more, thinking I should visit him instead of only seeing him at holidays. I don’t think it was divorces he collected. I think I could learn something from him.
