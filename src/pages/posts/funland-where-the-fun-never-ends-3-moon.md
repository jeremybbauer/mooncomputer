excerpt: I put my fingers behind the arcade cabinet in front of me and tried to
  slide them down. “I can’t reach back there,” I said. “Can you use your mammoth

“You hear that humming? I think there’s power in here. It’s like that thing where you can tell the TV’s on even though the screen’s blank.”

“Yesss. Awesome! Everything else here has been dead.” said Lacey. 

“None of the games are on. Maybe we need to turn them off and back on or something.”

We both squinted around in the half-light trying to discern the meaning of shapes. We pressed the circles, moved the knobs, pushed any square buttons we could.

“Oh, I just remembered I was with Olivia once when she opened this place for the day,” said Lacey. “I think they have power switches on the back of them. Maybe towards the bottom?”

I put my fingers behind the arcade cabinet in front of me and tried to slide them down. “I can’t reach back there,” I said. “Can you use your mammoth strength to pull it out?”

“T’would be my pleasure, milady. You need but to ask and your royal mammoth is at your service.” 

“Brilliant, mi-mammoth milady. Uh…Indubitably!”

We both chuckled as I moved out of Lacey’s way. Sometimes she looks like a beautiful giant that could throw a car at the moon. She’s only, like, three inches taller than me, but I think she can transform those extra inches into pure muscle. 

Lacey put one hand on each side of the cabinet. She let out a good bear grunt, then pulled it out a foot and over into a 45-degree angle in a single smooth, tough motion. Before I could say *damn*, we both screamed, "Shit!" as a flash of white shot past us and out the cracked door.
