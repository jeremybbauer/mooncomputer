The ghost floats in tiny circles by a metal table in the corner. There’s a super old — like, 80s or something — dirty boombox and a bunch of cassettes on the table. A few tapes are scattered on the floor. And there’s other random shit in here: a pile of ferns and hyacinths, a cracked in half computer, a Garfield mug, a lone turnera, five pairs of hypercolor sweatpants, and an empty terrarium.

“Oh, shit. You know Zaza?”

The ghost nodded.

“Who’s that, D?”

“Gary, you have a mom and dad. I have my Zaza.”

“Oh, gotcha…Man, I got some questions. I’ll let you and this…uh…family friend catch up or whatever in a second. ‘Ey, sir, have you seen a younger guy, looks a little like me come through here? Answers to Percy?”

The ghost just floats, its tiny circles unwavering.

“This doesn’t feel right,” says Estelle.
